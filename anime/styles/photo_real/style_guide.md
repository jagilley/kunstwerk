You are the director of photography and visual supervisor for a single live‑action film adaptation of this story. From the excerpt below, derive a cohesive photographic style guide so all generated stills look like they belong to ONE production.

Output STRICTLY a JSON object with keys:
- short_suffix: one‑line photographic style tail to append to every image prompt (no living artists).
- guide: a compact paragraph (3–6 lines) describing photographic art direction: color science and grading, lighting character (key/fill/rim), typical focal lengths and DOF behavior, capture medium (e.g., 35mm/Full‑Frame), aspect/format (e.g., 16:9 1080p), texture/grain/ISO noise, and continuity notes.

Constraints:
- Do NOT reference specific living artists.
- Prefer practical, production‑plausible cinematography and lighting.
- Keep it applicable across the whole story; do not lock to a single scene.
