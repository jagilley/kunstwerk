ACT ONE

Prelude

No. 1 Scene and Chorus

A square in Seville
(On the right, the door of a tobacco factory. At the
back, facing the audience, a bridge from one side
of the stage to the other, reached from the stage
by a winding staircase beyond the factory door. The
bridge is open underneath. In front, a guard-house;
in front of that, three steps leading to a covered
passage. As the curtain rises, a file of soldiers
(dragoons of Almanza) are grouped before the
guard-house, smoking and looking at the passers-
by in the square coming and going from all parts.
The scene is full of animation.)

SOLDIERS
On the square
everyone comes by,
everyone comes and goes;
funny sort of people these!

MORALÈS
At the guard-house door,
to kill time,
we smoke, gossip and watch
the passers-by.

SOLDIERS and MORALÈS
On the square, etc.
(Micaëla enters.)

MORALÈS
Now look at this little lass
who seems to want to speak to us.
Look, she's turning round, she's hesitating.

SOLDIERS
We must go and help her!

MORALÈS (to Micaëla)
Whom are you looking for, pretty one?

MICAËLA
I'm looking for a corporal.

MORALÈS
Here I am, look!

MICAËLA
My corporal is called
Don José...do you know him?

MORALÈS
Don José? We all know him.

MICAËLA
Really! is he with you, please?

MORALÈS
He isn't a corporal in our company.

MICAËLA (disappointed)
Then he isn't here?

MORALÈS
No, my charmer, he isn't here.
But in a few minutes he will be,
he'll be here when the new guard
comes to relieve the old guard.

SOLDIERS and MORALÈS
He'll be here, etc.

MORALÈS
But while you wait for him to come
will you, my pretty child,
take the trouble
to step inside with us for a moment?

MICAËLA
Inside with you?

SOLDIERS and MORALÈS
Inside with us.

MICAËLA
No, no.
Many thanks, soldiers.

MORALÈS
Don't be afraid to come in, my dear,
I promise you we shall treat
your dear self
with every due respect.

MICAËLA
I don't doubt it; all the same
I'll come back, that's wiser.
I'll be back when the new guard
comes to relieve the old guard.

SOLDIERS and MORALÈS
You must stay, because the new guard
is on its way to relieve the old guard.

MORALÈS
You'll stay!

MICAËLA
Indeed I'll not!

SOLDIERS and MORALÈS (surround Micaëla)
You'll stay!

MICAËLA
Indeed I'll not! No, no, no!
Goodbye, soldiers!
(She escapes and runs off.)

MORALÈS
The bird has flown;
we'll console ourselves.
Let's resume our pastime
and watch the folks go by.

SOLDIERS
On the square
everyone comes by, etc.

No. 2 Chorus of Street Boys

(A military march of bugles and fifes is heard in
the distance. The relief guard arrives; an officer
comes out of the guard-house. Soldiers take their
muskets and form up in front of the guard-house.
The passers-by gather in a group to watch the
parade. The military march comes nearer and
nearer. At last the relief guard emerges and
crosses the bridge. First, two bugles and two fifes.
Then a band of street urchins. Behind the children,
Lieutenant Zuniga and Corporal Don José, then the
troopers.)

CHORUS OF STREET BOYS
Right beside the relief guard,
here we come, here we are!
Blow out, loud trumpet!
Taratata, taratata!
We march with head erect
like little soldiers,
keeping time with no mistakes -
one, two - keeping step.
Shoulders back
and chest well out,
arms this way
straight down beside the body.
Right beside the relief guard, etc.
(The relief guard halts facing the guard going off
duty. The officers salute with their swords and
begin to talk in low voices. The sentries are
changed.)

MORALÈS (to Don José)
A charming young girl

has just been asking us
if you were here.
Blue skirt and long plaited hair.

JOSÉ
That must be Micaëla.
(The old guard passes before the newcomers. The
gang of street boys resume the place they
occupied when they arrived, behind the drums and
fifes.)

CHORUS OF STREET BOYS (reprise)
And the old guard
goes off home to barracks -
blow out, loud trumpet!
Tararara, taratata!
We march with head erect
like little soldiers, etc.
(Soldiers, urchins and idlers go off at the back;
the sound of chorus, fifes and bugles grows fainter.
The commander of the new guard,
during this time, inspects his men silently.
When the chorus of street boys can no longer be heard,
the soldiers enter the guard-house.
Don José and Zuniga remain.)

Recitative

ZUNIGA
Surely it's there, isn't it,
in that big building,
that the cigarette girls work?

JOSÉ
It is, sir,

and quite certainly
you never saw such a flighty lot of girls.

ZUNIGA
But they're pretty, at least?

JOSÉ
Sir, I know nothing about that,
and don't concern myself with these gallantries.

ZUNIGA
I know very well, my friend,
what's keeping you busy;
a charming young girl
called Micaëla,
in a blue skir t and long plaited hair.
Have you nothing to say to that?

JOSÉ
I reply that it's true,
I reply that I love her!
As for the factory girls there,
as to their prettiness - here they are!
And you can judge for yourself.

No. 3 Chorus of Cigarette Girls

(The square fills up with young men who have

come to intercept the cigarette girls. The soldiers
come out of the guard-house. Don José sits down
on a seat, and remains quite indifferent to all the
comings and going, working on a little chain for his
priming pin.)

YOUNG MEN
The bell has rung; we've come here
to catch the factory girls on their way back;
and we'll follow you, dark-haired cigarette girls,
murmuring words of love to you!
(At this point the girls appear,
smoking cigarettes.)

SOLDIERS
Look at them! Impudent glances,
Saucy airs,
all of them puffing away
at a cigarette.

CIGARETTE GIRLS
We gaze after the smoke
as it rises in the air,
sweet-smelling,
towards the skies.
Gracefully it mounts
to your head,
so gently
it exhilarates you!
Lover's soft talk -
it's smoke!
Their raptures and promises -
smoke!

We gaze after the smoke
as it rises, etc.

SOLDIERS
But we don't see la Carmencita!
(Carmen enters.)

CIGARETTE GIRLS and YOUNG MEN
There she is! There she is!
There's La Carmencita!
(She has a bunch of cassia flowers at her bodice,
and a cassia flower in the corner of her mouth.
The young men come in with Carmen. They follow
her, surround her, talk to her. She flirts with them
in an offhand fashion. Don José looks up. He
glances at Carmen and then quietly resumes his work.)

YOUNG MEN
Carmen, we all throng after you!
Carmen, be kind, answer us at least,
and tell us when you're going to love us!

Recitative

CARMEN (with a glance at Don José)
When am I going to love you?
My word, I don't know.
Perhaps never, perhaps tomorrow;
but not today, that's certain.

No. 4 Habanera

CARMEN
Love is a rebellious bird
that no one can tame,
and it's quite useless to call him
if it suits him refuse.
Nothing moves him, neither threat nor plea,
one man speaks freely, the other keeps mum;
and it's the other one I prefer:
he's said nothing, but I like him.
Love! etc.

CHORUS
Love is a rebellious bird, etc.

CARMEN
Love is a gypsy child,
he has never heard of law.
If you don't love me, I love you;
if I love you, look out for yourself! etc.

CHORUS
Look out for yourself! etc.
Love is a gypsy child etc.

CARMEN
The bird you thought to catch unawares
beats its wings and away it flew -
love's far away, and you can wait for it:
you wait for it no longer - and there it is.
All around you, quickly, quickly,
it comes, it goes, then it returns -

you think you can hold it, it evades you,
you think to evade it, it holds you fast.
Love! etc.

CHORUS
All around you, etc.

CARMEN
Love is a gypsy child,
he has never heard of law.
If you don't love me, I love you;
if I love you, look out for yourself!
If you don't love me, I love you, etc.

CHORUS
Look out for yourself! etc.
Love is a gypsy child etc.

No. 5 Scene

YOUNG MEN
Carmen, we all throng after you!
Carmen, be kind, answer us at least!
(A pause. The young men surround Carmen, who
looks at them one by one. Then she breaks
through the circle and goes straight to Don José,
who is still busied with his little chain.)

CARMEN
What are you up to there?...

JOSÉ
I'm making a chain to fix my priming-pin.

CARMEN
Truly! Your priming-pin, really!...Pin-maker of my heart...
(Carmen throws the cassia flower at Don José. He
jumps up. The flower has fallen at his feet.
Outburst of general laughter.)

CIGARETTE GIRLS (surrounding Don José)
Love is a gypsy child, etc.
(The factory bell rings again. Carmen and the other
cigarette girls run into the factory. Exeunt young
men, etc. The soldiers go into the guard-house,
who had been chatting to two or three of the girls.
Don José is left alone.)

Recitative

JOSÉ
What looks! What brazen impudence!
That flower had the effect
of a bullet striking me!
Its scent is strong and it's a pretty flower!
And the woman...
If there really are witches
she's certainly one.

MICAËLA (entering)
José!

JOSÉ
Micaëla!

MICAËLA
Here I am!

JOSÉ
How lovely!

MICAËLA
It's your mother who sent me.

No. 6 Duet

JOSÉ
Tell me about my mother!

MICAËLA
A faithful messenger, I bring from her
this letter...

JOSÉ
A letter!

MICAËLA
And then a little money
to add to your pay.
And then...

JOSÉ
And then?

MICAËLA
And then...really, I dare not,
and then yet another thing
worth more than money
at which a good son
will surely value higher.

JOSÉ
This other thing, what is it?
Tell me, then.

MICAËLA
Yes, I'll tell you:
what was given to me
I'll give to you.
Your mother and I were coming out of the chapel,
And then, as she kissed me,
"You will go to town," she said.
"It's not far; once in Seville
you'll seek out my son, my José, my boy.
And you'll tell him that his mother
thinks night and day of her absent one,
that she grieves and hopes,
that she forgives and waits.
All that, little one,
you'll tell him from me, won't you;
and this kiss that I'm giving you
you'll give him from me."

JOSÉ
A kiss from my mother!

MICAËLA
A kiss for her son!
José, I give it to you
as I promised.
(Micaëla raises herself on tiptoe and gives Don
José a frank, motherly kiss. José, very moved, lets

her. He gazes into her eyes.
There is a moment of silence.)

JOSÉ
I see my mother!
Yes, I see my village again!
O memories of bygone days,
sweet memories of home!
Sweet memories of home!
O precious memories!
You put back strength
and courage into my heart,
O precious memories!
I see my mother!
I see my village again!

MICAËLA
He sees his mother again!
He sees his village once more!
O memories of bygone days!
Memories of home!
You put back strength
and courage into his heart!
O precious memories!
He sees his mother again,
he sees his village again!

JOSÉ (his eyes fixed on the factory)
Who knows into what demon's clutches

I was about to fall!
Even from afar my mother protects me,
and this kiss she sent me,
wards off the peril and saves her son!

MICAËLA
What demon? What peril?
I don't quite understand.
What do you mean by that?

JOSÉ
Nothing! Nothing!
Let's talk about you, the messenger.
You're going back home?

MICAËLA
Yes, this very evening:
tomorrow I shall see your mother.

JOSÉ
You'll be seeing her!
Well then, you'll tell her -
that her son loves and reveres her
and that today he is repentant;
he wants his mother back there
to be pleased with him!
All this, my sweet,
you'll tell her from me, won't you,
and this kiss that I give you
you'll give her from me.
(He kisses her.)

MICAËLA
Yes, I promised you; from her son

José I shall give it as I have promised.

JOSÉ
I see my mother! etc.

MICAËLA
He sees his mother again! etc.

Recitative

JOSÉ
Wait there, now,
while I'm reading.

MICAËLA
No. Read first
and then I'll come back.

JOSÉ
Why go away?

MICAËLA
It's wiser.
It suits me better that way.
Read! Then I'll come back.

JOSÉ
You will come back?

MICAËLA
I'll come back.
(She leaves.)

JOSÉ
Never fear, mother your son will obey you

and do as you say; I love Micaëla
and I shall take her for my wife.
As for your flowers, filthy witch... !

No. 7 Chorus

(Just as he is about to tear the flower from his
tunic, an uproar begins in the factory. Zuniga
comes on stage, followed by soldiers.)

ZUNIGA
Whatever's going on over there?

FIRST GROUP OF GIRLS
Help! Help!
Can't you hear?

SECOND GROUP OF GIRLS
Help! Help!
You soldiers!

FIRST GROUP OF GIRLS
It's Carmencita!

SECOND GROUP OF GIRLS
No, no, it's not her!
Not a bit of it!

FIRST GROUP OF GIRLS
It's her! It is, it is! It's her!
She started the fighting!

SECOND GROUP OF GIRLS
Don't listen to them!

ALL THE GIRLS (surrounding Zuniga)
Listen to us, sir!
Listen to us! etc.

SECOND GROUP OF GIRLS
(pulling the officer to their side)
Manuelita said, and kept saying
at the top of her voice,
that she'd make sure she bought
a donkey that pleased her.

FIRST GROUP OF GIRLS
Then Carmencita,
in her usual mocking way,
said; "A donkey? What for?
A broom will do for you."

SECOND GROUP OF GIRLS
Manuelita retorted,
and said to her friend:
"For a certain ride
my donkey will be useful to you! - "

FIRST GROUP OF GIRLS
" - And on that day you'll be able
to play the lady in your own right;
two lackeys will follow behind
keeping flies off as best they can!"

ALL THE GIRLS
Thereupon they both started
to pull each other's hair out!

ZUNIGA
To the devil with all this chatter!

José, take two men in with you
and see who's causing all this commotion.
(Don José takes two men with him. The soldiers go
into the factory. All this while the girls are pushing
and arguing among themselves.)

FIRST GROUP OF GIRLS
It's Carmencita! etc.

SECOND GROUP OF GIRLS
No, no! It's not she! etc.

ZUNIGA
Stop!
Rid me of all these women!

ALL THE GIRLS
Sir, don't listen to them! etc.
(The soldiers keep the girls back. Carmen appears
at the factory door, led by Don José and followed
by two dragoons. The factory-girls go out in a
disorderly rush.)

No. 8 Song and Melodrama

JOSÉ
Sir, there was a quarrel,
insults first, then blows to end up with;
one woman hurt.

ZUNIGA
And by whom?

JOSÉ
Why by her.

ZUNIGA (to Carmen)
You hear - what have you to say?

CARMEN
Tralalalala,
cut me, burn me,
I shall tell you nothing;
tralalala,
I defy everything -
fire, the sword, and heaven itself!

ZUNIGA
Spare us your songs,
and since you've been told to answer - answer!

CARMEN
Tralalalala,
I'm keeping my secret, and keeping it well!
Tralalalala,
I love another,
and will die saying I love him.

ZUNIGA
Since you adopt that attitude
you'll sing your song to the prison walls.

CHORUS
In prison! In prison!
(Carmen tries to get at the girls.)

ZUNIGA (to Carmen)
Plague on it!

Decidedly you have a ready hand!

CARMEN
Tralalalala...

ZUNIGA
It's a pity,
a great pity,
because she's nice, really!
But she must be made to see sense;
bind those two lovely arms.
(Zuniga leaves. A brief pause. Carmen raises her
eyes and looks at Don José. He turns, withdraws a
few paces, then comes back to Carmen who has
been watching him all the while.)

CARMEN
Where are you taking me?

JOSÉ
To prison, and there's nothing I can do.

CARMEN
Really, you can't do anything?

JOSÉ
No, nothing! I obey my superiors.

CARMEN
Very well, but I know

that in spite of your superiors
you'll do everything I want,
and that because you love me!

JOSÉ
I, love you?

CARMEN
Yes, José!
The flower I made you a present of,
you know, the witch's flower -
you can throw it away now.
The spell is working!

JOSÉ
Don't talk to me any more! You hear me?
Say no more. I forbid it!

No. 9 Seguidilla and Duet

CARMEN
By the ramparts of Seville,
at my friend Lillas Pastia's place,
I'm going to dance the seguidilla
and drink manzanilla.
I'm going to my friend Lillas Pastia's!
Yes, but all alone one gets bored,
and real pleasures are for two.
So, to keep me company,
I shall take my lover!
My lover... he's gone to the devil:
I showed him the door yesterday.
My poor heart, so consolable -
my heart is as free as air.

I have suitors by the dozen,
but they are not to my liking.
Here we are at the week end;
Who wants to love me? I'll love him.
Who wants my heart? It's for the taking!
You've come at the right moment!
I have hardly time to wait,
for with my new lover...
By the ramparts of Seville, etc.

JOSÉ
Stop! I told you not to talk to me!

CARMEN
I'm not talking to you,
I'm singing to myself;
and I'm thinking... It's not forbidden to think!
I'm thinking about a certain officer
who loves me,
and whom in my turn I might really love!

JOSÉ
Carmen!

CARMEN
My officer's not a captain,
not even a lieutenant,
he's only a corporal;
but that's enough for a gypsy girl
and I'll deign to content myself with him!

JOSÉ
(untying Carmen's hands)

Carmen, I'm like a drunken man,
if I yield, if I give in,
you'll keep your promise?
Ah! if I love you. Carmen, you'll love me?

CARMEN
Yes...
We'll dance the seguidilla
while we drink manzanilla.

JOSÉ
At Lillas Pastia's...
You promise!
Carmen...
You promise!

CARMEN
Ah! By the ramparts of Seville, etc.
(Her hands behind her, Carmen goes and re-seats
herself on her stool. Zuniga returns.)

No. 10 Finale

ZUNIGA (to José)
Here's the order; off you go now.
And keep a good lookout.

CARMEN (aside to José)
On the way I shall push you,

I shall push you as hard as I can...
Let yourself fall over...
The rest is up to me.
(Carmen places herself between the two dragoons,
with José at her side. The girls and others return
onstage, kept back by the soldiers. Carmen
crosses the stage, moving towards the bridge.)

Love is a gypsy child,
he has never heard of law.
If you don't love me, I love you;
if I love you, look out for yourself.
(Arriving at the foot of the bridge, Carmen pushes
José who falls. In the confusion Carmen takes to
her heels. At the middle of the bridge she stops
for a moment, sends her cord flying over the
parapet of the bridge, and escapes, while the
cigarette girls, with great shouts of laughter,
surround Zuniga.)

Entr'acte

ACT TWO

The tavern of Lillas Pastia
(Carmen, Mercédès, Frasquita, Lieutenant Zuniga,
Moralès and another lieutenant are there. A meal
has just been finished and the table is in disorder.
The officers and gypsy girls are smoking. Two
gypsies are strumming guitars in a corner of the
room; in the middle, two gypsy girls are singing.
Carmen, seated, is watching them dance. An
officer is talking to her quietly, but she pays him no
attention whatsoever. Suddenly she gets up and
begins to sing.)

No. 11 Gypsy Song

CARMEN
The sistrums' rods were jingling
with a metallic clatter,
and at this strange music
the zingarellas leapt to their feet.
Tambourines were keeping time
and the frenzied guitars
ground away under persistent hands,
the same song, the same refrain.
Tralalalala...
(During the refrain the gypsy girls dance, and
Mercédès and Frasquita join Carmen in singing:
Tralalalala.)
Copper and silver rings
glittered on ducky skins;
Orange- and red-striped
dresses floated in the wind.
Dance and song became one -

at first timid and hesitant,
then livelier and faster
it grew and grew!
Tralalalala...
The gypsy boys stormed away
on their instruments with all their might,
and this deafening uproar
bewitched the zingaras!
Beneath the rhythm of the song,
passionate, wild, fired with excitement,
they let themselves be carried away,
intoxicated, by the whirlwind!
Tralalalala...

Recitative

FRASQUITA
Gentlemen, Pastia tells me...

ZUNIGA
What does Master Pastia want this time?

FRASQUITA
He says the corregidor
wants the inn closed.

ZUNIGA
Oh, well, we'll go.
You'll come with us.

FRASQUITA
No, we're staying.

ZUNIGA
And you, Carmen? Aren't you coming?

Listen, a word in your ear;
you've a grudge against me.

CARMEN
A grudge against you! Why?

ZUNIGA
That soldier sent to prison the other day because
of you...

CARMEN
What have they done with the poor chap?

ZUNIGA
He's free now!

CARMEN
He's free! So much the better.
Goodnight to you, gentlemen-admirers!

CARMEN, FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS
Goodnight to you, gentlemen-admirers!

No. 12 Chorus

CHORUS (outside)
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Toreador!
Hurrah! Hurrah for Escamillo!

ZUNIGA
A torchlight procession!
It's the winner of the Granada bullfights.
(Escamillo appears.)
Will you drink with us, comrade?

To your past and future triumphs!

CHORUS
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Toreador!
Hurrah! Hurrah for Escamillo!

No. 13 (Toreador's Song)

ESCAMILLO
I can return your toast,
gentlemen, for soldiers -
yes - and bullfighters understand each other;
fighting is their game!
The ring is packed, it's a holiday,
the ring is full from top to bottom.
The spectators, losing their wits,
yell at each other at the tops of their voices!
Exclamations, cries and uproar
carried to the pitch of fury!
For this is the fiesta of courage,
this is the fiesta of the stouthearted!
Let's go! On guard! Ah!
Toreador, on guard!
And remember, yes, remember as you fight,
that two dark eyes are watching you,
that love awaits you!
Toreador, love awaits you!

CHORUS
Toreador, on guard! etc.
(Carmen refills Escamillo's glass.)

ESCAMILLO
Suddenly everyone falls silent;

ah - what's happening?
No more shouts, this is the moment!
The bull comes bounding
out of the toril!
He charges, comes in, strikes!
A horse rolls over, dragging down a picador!
"Ah! Bravo bull!" roars the crowd;
the bull turns, comes back,
comes back and strikes again!
Shaking his banderillas,
maddened with rage, he runs about!
The ring is covered with blood!
Men jump clear, leap the barriers.
It's your turn now!
Let's go! On guard! Ah!
Toreador, on guard! etc.

CHORUS
Toreador, on guard! etc.

Recitative

(Everyone drinks, then exchanges handclasps with
the matador. The officers get ready to go.
Escamillo finds himself at Carmen's side.)

ESCAMILLO
A word, pretty one:
what do they call you?
In my worst danger
I want to utter your name.

CARMEN
Carmen! Carmencita!
It comes to the same thing!

ESCAMILLO
If someone told you he loved you?...

CARMEN
I should reply that I don't need loving.

ESCAMILLO
That's not a friendly answer;
I'll content myself with hoping and waiting.

CARMEN
To wait is permitted, to hope is sweet.

ZUNIGA
Since you're not coming, Carmen, I shall return.

CARMEN
And you'll be making a big mistake!

ZUNIGA
Bah! I'll take the risk!
(Zuniga and Escamillo leave. Le Dancaïre and Le
Remendado enter.)

Recitative

FRASQUITA
Well now, quickly, what's new?

LE DANCAÏRE
The news isn't too bad,
and we may yet be able to pull off
some good jobs!
But we require your services.

FRASQUITA, MERCÉDÈS and CARMEN
Our services?

LE DANCAÏRE
Yes, we require your services.

No. 14 Quintet

We have a scheme in mind.

MERCÉDÈS and FRASQUITA
Tell us, is it good?

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
It's admirable, my dear;
but we require your services.

ALL FIVE
Ours? etc.
Yours! etc.

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
For we humbly
and most respectfully acknowledge:
when it's a question of trickery,
of deception, of thieving,
it's always good, I swear,
to have women around.
And without them,
my lovelies,
no one ever does
any good!

FRASQUITA, MERCÉDÈS and CARMEN
What? Without us no one does
any good?

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
Isn't that your opinion?

FRASQUITA, MERCÉDÈS and CARMEN
Indeed, that's
my opinion.
Yes indeed, really it is.

QUINTET
When it's a question of trickery, etc.

LE DANCAÏRE
It's settled then; you'll go?

FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS
Whenever you like.

LE DANCAÏRE
Why, straight away.

CARMEN
Ah! Just a moment!
If you want to go, go;
but I'm not in on this trip.
I won't go! I won't go!

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
Carmen, my love, you will come -

CARMEN
I won't go! I won't go!

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
And you won't have the heart
to leave us in the lurch.

FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS
Ah! my Carmen, you will come.

CARMEN
I won't go! etc.

LE DANCAÏRE
But the reason, Carmen,
at least you'll tell us the reason.

QUARTET
The reason, the reason!

CARMEN
Certainly I'll give it.

QUARTET
Let's have it! Let's have it!

CARMEN
The reason is that at this moment...

QUARTET
Well? Well?

CARMEN
I'm in love!

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO (astonished)
What did she say?

FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS
She said she's in love!

QUARTET
In love!

CARMEN
Yes, in love!

LE DANCAÏRE
See here, Carmen, be serious!

CARMEN
Head over heels in love!

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
This is certainly astonishing,
but it's not the first time,
my pet, that you've been able
to combine love and duty.

CARMEN
My friends, I'd be most happy
to go with you this evening;
but this time - don't be annoyed -
love must come before duty.

LE DANCAÏRE
That's not your final word?

CARMEN
Absolutely!

LE REMENDADO
You must relent.

QUARTET
You must come, Carmen, you must come!

It's necessary
for our scheme,
for between ourselves...

CARMEN
As to that, I admit with you that...

QUINTET (reprise)
When it's a question of trickery, etc.

Recitative

LE DANCAÏRE
But what are you waiting for?

CARMEN
Nothing much - a soldier who,
for doing me a good turn the other day,
was clapped in prison.

LE REMENDADO
It's a delicate situation.

LE DANCAÏRE
After all, it's possible
your soldier may have second thoughts.
Are you quite sure that he'll come?

No. 15 Song

JOSÉ (in the far distance)
Halt!
Who goes there?
Dragoon of Alcala!

CARMEN
Listen!

JOSÉ
Where are you going there,
Dragoon of Alcala? -

CARMEN
There he is!

JOSÉ
Me, I'm going to make
my rival
bite the dust. -
If that's the case,
pass, my friend.
An affair of honour,
an affair of the heart -
that explains everything for us
Dragoons of Alcala!

FRASQUITA
He's a handsome dragoon.

MERCÉDÈS
A very handsome dragoon!

LE DANCAÏRE
- Who might be a useful companion for us.

LE REMEMDADO
Tell him to come with us.

CARMEN
He will refuse.

LE DANCAÏRE
But try, at least.

CARMEN
All right, I'll try.
(Le Remendado goes out, Le Dancaïre following
him with the girls.)

JOSÉ (the sound of his voice considerably closer)
Halt!
Who goes there?
Dragoon of Alcala!
Where are you going there,
Dragoon of Alcala? -
Punctual and faithful,
I go where the love
of my fair lady calls me! -
If that's the case,
pass, friend.
An affair of the heart,
an affair of the heart,
that explains everything for us
Dragoons of Alcala!
(Don José enters.)

Recitative

CARMEN
So it's you!

JOSÉ
Carmen!

CARMEN
And you're just out of prison?

JOSÉ
I was there two months.

CARMEN
You're complaining about it?

JOSÉ
Faith, no!
And if it was for you
I'd gladly be there still.

CARMEN
You love me, then?

JOSÉ
I adore you!

CARMEN
Your officers were here recently;
they got us to dance.

JOSÉ
What, you?

CARMEN
May I die if you're not jealous!

JOSÉ
I'm jealous all right!

No. 16 Duet

CARMEN
Softly, sir, softly.
I am going to dance in your honour,
and you will see, my lord,
how I am able to accompany my dance!
Sit down there, Don José. I'll begin!

(She makes José sit down in a corner, and starts
to dance, humming and accompanying herself with
her castanets. José is entranced. Bugles are heard
in the distance sounding Retreat. José cocks an
ear. He comes over to Carmen and compels her to
stop.)

JOSÉ
Wait a little, Carmen, only for a moment, stop!

CARMEN
And why, if you please?

JOSÉ
I think, over there...
yes, those are our bugles sounding
Retreat!
Can't you hear them?

CARMEN
Bravo! Bravo! I was trying in vain;

it's dismal
dancing without an orchestra.
And long live music
that drops on us out of the skies!
(She resumes her song. The bugles sound nearer,
pass beneath the windows of the inn, then fade in
the distance.)

JOSÉ
You didn't understand me, Carmen,
it's Retreat;
I've got to get back to quarters
for roll-call.

CARMEN
To quarters! For roll-call!
Ah! Really I was too stupid!
I went out of my way
and took the trouble,
yes, took the trouble
to entertain the gentleman!
I sang! I danced!
I believe, God forgive me,
I almost fell in love!
Taratata!
It's the bugle sounding!
Taratata!
He's off! He's gone!
Go, you're yellow as your tunic!
(angrily throwing his cap at him)
Here! take your shako,
your sword, your bandolier;

and clear off, my son, clear off!
Clear off back to your barracks!

JOSÉ
It's cruel of you, Carmen, to make fun of me!
It pains me to go, for never has a woman -
never before you has any women
so deeply stirred my heart!

CARMEN
"Taratata, my God! It's the Retreat!
Taratata, I'm going to be late!"
He loses his wits, he rushes off,
and that's his love!

JOSÉ
So you don't believe in my love?

CARMEN
Of course not!

JOSÉ
Very well! You shall listen to me!

CARMEN
I don't want to listen to anything!

JOSÉ
You shall hear me!

CARMEN
You're going to be late!

JOSÉ
You shall hear me!

CARMEN
No! No! No! No!

JOSÉ
Yes, you shall hear me!
I insist, Carmen!
You shall hear me!
(He reaches inside his tunic and takes out the
cassia flower Carmen threw him in Act One.)
The flower that you threw to me
stayed with me in my prison.
Withered and dried up, that flower
always kept its sweet perfume;
and for hours at a time,
with my eyes closed,
I became drunk with its smell
and in the night I used to see you!
I took to cursing you,
detesting you, asking myself
why did destiny
have to throw her across my path?
Then I accused myself of blasphemy,
and felt within myself,
I felt but one desire,
one desire, one hope:
to see you again, Carmen, to see you again!
For you had only to appear,
only to throw a glance my way,
to take possession of my whole being,
O my Carmen,
and I was your chattel!
Carmen, I love you!

CARMEN
No, you don't love me!

JOSÉ
What are you saying?

CARMEN
No, you don't love me,
no! For if you did,
you'd follow me
over there.

JOSÉ
Carmen!

CARMEN
Yes! -
Away over there into the mountains,
away over there you'd follow me.
You'd take me up behind you on your horse
and like a daredevil you'd carry me off
across the country!
Away over there into the mountains!

JOSÉ
Carmen!

CARMEN
Away over there you'd follow me,
if you loved me!
There you'd not be dependent on anyone;
there'd be no officer you had to obey,

and no Retreat sounding
to tell a lover
that it is time to go!
The open sky, the wandering life,
the whole wide world your domain;
for law your own free will,
and above all, that intoxicating thing:
Freedom! Freedom!

JOSÉ
Oh God!

CARMEN
Away over there in the mountains, etc.

JOSÉ
Ah! Carmen, alas! Stop it! Have pity!

CARMEN
Yes, isn't it so,
you will follow me there,
you love me and you'll follow me!
Take me away over there!

JOSÉ
Ah! stop, stop!
No! I won't listen to you!
To abandon my colours - to desert...
that's shameful, that's dastardly!
I'll have none of it!

CARMEN
All right then go!

JOSÉ
Carmen, I implore you!

CARMEN
No, I don't love you any more!

JOSÉ
Listen!

CARMEN
Go! I hate you!
Goodbye! And goodbye for ever!

JOSÉ
All right, so be it...goodbye for ever!

CARMEN
Get out!

JOSÉ
Carmen! Goodbye, goodbye for ever!

CARMEN
Goodbye!
(Don José hurries towards the door; just as he
reaches it, somebody knocks.)

No. 17 Finale

ZUNIGA (outside)
Hallo there, Carmen! Hallo! Hallo!

JOSÉ
Who's that knocking? Who's there?

CARMEN
Keep quiet!

ZUNIGA (forcing the door)
I'm opening up myself, and coming in.
(sees Don José - to Carmen)
Ah! fie, fie! My lovely lady!
This isn't a happy choice; it's demeaning
to take the soldier when you've got the officer.
(to Don José)
Off with you, get moving!

JOSÉ
No!

ZUNIGA
You certainly will go!

JOSÉ
I shall not go!

ZUNIGA (striking him)
Scoundrel!

JOSÉ (drawing his sword)
By thunder! It's going to rain blows!

CARMEN (throwing herself between them)
Devil take the jealous!
(calling)
Help! Help!
(Gypsies appear from all sides. Carmen points to
Zuniga. Le Dancaïre and Le Remendado hurl
themselves upon him and disarm him.)

CARMEN
My fine officer! My fine officer, love
at the moment is playing you a rather dirty trick.
You arrival is most untimely; and alas, we are compelled,
not wishing to be betrayed,
to detain you...for at least an hour.

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
My dear sir,
if you please, we are going
to leave this establishment;
you'll come with us?

CARMEN
Just for a stroll.

LE DANCAÏRE and LE REMENDADO
Do you consent?

ALL THE GYPSIES
Answer, comrade.

ZUNIGA
Certainly,
the more so since your argument
is one of those that can hardly be resisted;
but take care! Look out for yourselves later!

LE DANCAÏRE
War is war!
Meantime, my good sir,
carry on without further argument!

LE REMENDADO and THE GYPSIES
Carry on without further argument!

(The officer is led out by four gypsies armed with
pistols.)

CARMEN (to Don José)
Are you one of us now?

JOSÉ
I have no alternative.

CARMEN
Ah! that's not gallantly put,
but no matter, go, you'll take to it there
when you see
how fine is the wandering life;
the whole world your domain,
your own free will for law,
and above all that intoxicating thing:
Freedom! Freedom!

ALL (to Don José)
Take to the country with us,
come with us into the mountains,
come with us and you'll take to it there
when you see, away over there,
how fine is the wandering life;
the whole world your domain,
your own free will for law!
And above all that intoxicating thing:
Freedom! Freedom!
The open sky, the wandering life,
the whole wide world your domain;
your own free will for law,
and above all that intoxicating thing:
Freedom! Freedom!

ACT THREE

No. 18 Sextet and Chorus

The curtain rises on a wild and rocky scene.
(The night is dark and the solitude complete.
During the musical prelude a smuggler appears at
the top of the rocks, then another, then two more,
and finally twenty here and there, climbing and
scrambling over the rocks. Some of them are
carrying heavy bales on their shoulders.)

CHORUS
Listen, friend, listen,
fortune lies over there,
but take care along the way,
and watch your step!

LE DANCAÏRE, LE REMENDADO, JOSÉ, CARMEN,

MERCÉDÈS and FRASQUITA
Our calling is a good one,
but to follow it you must
have a stout heart!
There's danger up above, and down below,
it's everywhere - what of it!
We go forward
without worrying about the torrent,
without worrying about the storm,
without worrying about the soldier
who's waiting for us over there,
and keeping a sharp lookout for us -
we go forward without worrying!

ALL
Listen, friend, listen, etc.

Recitative

LE DANCAÏRE
Let's rest here for an hour, comrades;
first, we'll go on ahead of you
and satisfy ourselves the way is clear,
and that the contraband
can get through unmolested.
(During this scene between Carmen and José, a
few gypsy men light a fire, by which Mercédès and
Frasquita come and sit down; the others roll
themselves up in their cloaks, lie down and go to
sleep.)

CARMEN (to José)
What are you looking at like that?

JOSÉ
I'm telling myself that down there
lives a good and kind old lady
who believes me to be an honest man.
Alas, she is mistaken!

CARMEN
And who is this lady?

JOSÉ
Ah, Carmen, by my soul, don't jeer...
because it's my mother.

CARMEN
Well then, go and find her right away!
Our calling, you see, means nothing to you.
And you would do very well to leave as you can

JOSÉ
Go away, and leave you?

CARMEN
Undoubtedly.

JOSÉ
Leave you, Carmen?
Listen, if you say that word again!...

CARMEN
You would kill me, perhaps?
What a look - you don't answer...
What do I care? After all, Fate is master.

No. 19 Trio

(She turns her back on José and goes to sit down
near Mercédès and Frasquita. After a moment of
indecision, José too goes off and stretches out on
the rocks. During the last exchanges Mercédès
and Frasquita have been spreading out cards.)

FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS
Shuffle! Cut!
Good, that's that!
Three cards here...
four there!
And now speak, my loveliness,
give us news of the future;
tell us who's going to betray us,
tell us who's going to love us!
Speak! Speak!

FRASQUITA
Me, I see a young suitor,
no one could love me more.

MERCÉDÈS
Mine is very rich and very old,
but he talks of marriage.

FRASQUITA
I settle myself firmly on his horse
and he carries me off into the mountains.

MERCÉDÈS
In an almost royal castle
mine installs me in queenly state!

FRASQUITA
Never-ending love,
every day new raptures!

MERCÉDÈS
As much gold as I can take,
diamonds, precious stones!

FRASQUITA
Mine becomes a famous leader,
a hundred men march in his train!

MERCÉDÈS
Mine...can I believe my eyes?
Yes...he dies!
Ah! I'm a widow and I inherit!

FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS (reprise)
Speak again, speak, my lovelies, etc.
(They begin to consult the cards again.)

MERCÉDÈS
Fortune!

FRASQUITA
Love!

CARMEN
Let's see - let me have a try.
(She starts to turn up the cards.)
Diamond, spade...Death!
I read it clearly...me first.
Then him...for both of us, Death!
In vain to avoid bitter replies,
in vain will you shuffle;
that achieves nothing, the cards
are truthful and will not lie!
If your page in the book
up above is a happy one
shuffle and cut without fear,
the card under your fingers will turn up nicely,
foretelling good luck.
But if you are to die,
if the terrible word

has been written by Destiny,
begin twenty times - the pitiless card
will repeat: Death!
(turning up the cards)
Again! Always Death!

FRASQUITA and MERCÉDÈS
Speak again, my lovelies, speak! etc.

CARMEN
Again! Despair!
Always Death!
(Le Dancaïre and Le Remendado enter.)

Recitative

CARMEN
All right?

LE DANCAÏRE
All right! We'll try to get through,
and we shall get through!
You wait up there, José; guard the stuff.

FRASQUITA
Is the way open?

LE DANCAÏRE
Yes, but watch out for surprises!
I saw three customs men on the pass
we must go through:
we must get rid of them.

CARMEN
Take up the packs and let's go;
we must get through, we shall get through!

No. 20 Ensemble

CARMEN, MERCÉDÈS and FRASQUITA
As for the customs man, he's our affair;
just like the next man he loves to please,
he loves to play the gallant;
ah! leave us to go on ahead!

ALL THE GIRLS
As for the customs man, he's our affair, etc.

EVERYONE
He loves to please!

MERCÉDÈS
The customs man will be easy on us!

ALL
He is gallant!

CARMEN
The customs man will be charming!

ALL
He loves to please!

FRASQUITA
The customs man will be gallant!

MERCÉDÈS
Yes, the customs man will even be forward!

ALL
Yes, the customs man is our/their affair;

just like the next man he loves to please,
he loves to play the gallant;
let them leave us go on ahead!

CARMEN, MERCÉDÈS and FRASQUITA
It's no longer a question of battle;
no, it's simply a question
of letting ourselves be taken by the waist
and listening to a compliment.
If it's necessary to go as far as a smile,
what of it? - we'll smile!

ALL THE WOMEN
And here and now I can say
the stuff will get though!
Forward! On our way! Let's go!

ALL
Yes, the customs man is our/their affair, etc.
(Everyone leaves. José brings up the rear,
examining the priming of his carbine; just before he
disappears, a man is seen moving behind a rock. It
is Micaëla's guide. The guide advances cautiously,
then signals to Micaëla that the coast is clear.)

Recitative

MICAËLA (looking about her)
This is the smugglers' usual haunt.
He is here, I shall see him...
and the duty his mother laid on me
I'll carry out without trembling.

No. 21 Air

MICAËLA
I say that nothing frightens me,
I say, alas, that I have only myself to depend on;
but I have tried in vain to be brave,
at heart I'm dying of fright!
Alone in this wild place,
all alone, I'm afraid,
but I do wrong to be afraid;
you will give me courage,
you will protect me, Lord.
I shall get a close look at this woman
whose evil wiles
have finished by making a criminal
of the man I once loved:
she is dangerous, she is beautiful,
but I won't be afraid,
I shall speak out in front of her.
Ah! Lord,
you will protect me!
Ah! I say that nothing will frighten me, etc.
...protect me, O Lord!
protect me, Lord!

Recitative

I'm not mistaken...it's he on that rock.
This way, José! José!
I can't come any nearer.
(terrified)
But what's he doing? He's aiming...firing...
(A shot is heard.)
Ah, my God! I overestimated my strength!
(She disappears behind the rocks. At the same
moment Escamillo comes in, holding his hat in his hand.)

No. 22 Duet

ESCAMILLO (examining his hat)
A little bit lower
and that would have been that.

JOSÉ (his knife in his hand)
Your name, answer!

ESCAMILLO
Hey! gently, friend!
I'm Escamillo, the Granada matador!

JOSÉ
Escamillo!

ESCAMILLO
That's me!

JOSÉ (returning his knife to its sheath)
I know your name.
You're welcome; but truly, comrade,
that could have been the end of you.

ESCAMILLO
I'm not denying it,
but, my friend, I am madly in love,
and he would be a wretched fellow
who wouldn't risk his life to see his ladylove!

JOSÉ
The girl you love is here?

ESCAMILLO
Exactly.
She's a gypsy girl, my friend.

JOSÉ
Her name?

ESCAMILLO
Carmen.

JOSÉ
Carmen!

ESCAMILLO
Carmen! yes, my friend. She had as a lover
a soldier who once deserted on her account.
They adored each other, but it's over, I think.
Carmen's affairs don't last six months.

JOSÉ
Yet you love her!

ESCAMILLO
I love her!
Yes, my friend, I love her to distraction!

JOSÉ
But to take our gypsy girls away from us
you know that you have to pay?

ESCAMILLO
All right! I'll pay.

JOSÉ
And that the price is paid with the knife!

ESCAMILLO
With the knife!

JOSÉ
You understand?

ESCAMILLO
You put it very clearly.
This deserter, this fine soldier she loves,
or rather, used to love -
is you, then?

JOSÉ
Yes, myself!

ESCAMILLO
I'm delighted, my friend,
and the wheel comes full circle!
(Both draw their knives and wrap their left arm in
their cloaks.)

JOSÉ
At last my rage
has found an outlet!
Blood, I hope,
will soon flow,

ESCAMILLO
What a predicament,
I could laugh at it really!
To look for the mistress
and find the lover!

TOGETHER
Put up your guard,
and look out for yourself!
So much the worse for the one
who's slow at parrying!
On guard! come on! look out for yourself!
(They fight. The matador slips and falls. Enter
Carmen and Le Dancaïre; she rushes forward and
stays José's hand. The matador gets to his feet;
Le Remendado, Mercédès, Frasquita and the
smugglers have meanwhile come upon the scene.)

No. 23 Finale

CARMEN
Stop, stop, José!

ESCAMILLO
Really, I'm overjoyed
that it should be you, Carmen, who saved my life!
(to Don José)
As for you, my fine soldier,
I'll take my revenge,
and we'll play for two out of three
whenever you wish to renew the fight!

LE DANCAÏRE
Enough, enough, no more quarrelling!
We must get going.
(to Escamillo)
And you, my friend, good night!

ESCAMILLO
Allow me at least, before I say goodbye,

to invite you all to the bullfights at Seville.
I expect to be at my most brilliant there,
and who loves me will come!
(to José, who makes a threatening gesture)
Friend, keep calm,
I've had my say, and I've nothing more
to do here but make my farewells!
(Leisurely exit of Escamillo. Don José tries to
attack him but is held back by Le Dancaïre and Le
Remendado.)

JOSÉ (to Carmen)
Take care, Carmen, I'm weary of suffering!
(Carmen answers him with a slight shrug of her
shoulders and walks off.)

LE DANCAÏRE
Let's get going! We must be off!

ALL
Let's get going! We must be off!

LE REMENDADO
Stop! there's someone there trying to hide!
(He brings in Micaëla.)

CARMEN
A woman!

LE DANCAÏRE
Lord, a pleasant surprise!

JOSÉ
Micaëla!

MICAËLA
Don José!

JOSÉ
Poor girl!
What are you doing here!

MICAËLA
I've come looking for you.
Down there is the cottage
where, praying unceasingly,
a mother, your mother,
weeps, alas, for her son.
She weeps and calls you,
she weeps and holds out her arms to you;
you will take pity on her,
José, ah José, you will come with me!

CARMEN
Go on! Go on! You'll do well to go;
our business means nothing to you!

JOSÉ
You're telling me to go with her?

CARMEN
Yes, you ought to go!

JOSÉ
You're telling me to go with her
so that you can run after
your new lover!
No! Not likely!
Though it should cost me my life,
no, Carmen, I shall not go away,

and the bond which unites us
shall unite us till death!
Though it should cost me my life, etc.

MICAËLA
Listen to me, I implore you,
your mother holds out her arms to you,
that bond which unites you,
José, you will break it!

FRASQUITA, MERCÉDÈS, LE REMENDADO,

LE DANCAÏRE and CHORUS
It will cost you your life,
José, if you don't go,
and the bond which unites you
will be broken by your death.

JOSÉ (to Micaëla)
Leave me!

MICAËLA
Alas, José!

JOSÉ
For I am doomed!

FRASQUITA, MERCÉDÈS, LE REMENDADO

LE DANCAÏRE and CHORUS
José take care!

JOSÉ (to Carmen)
Ah! I've got you, accursed girl,
I've got you, and I shall compel you
to bow to the destiny
that links your fate with mine!

Though it should cost me my life,
no, no, no, I shall not go!

CHORUS
Ah! Take care, take care, Don José!

MICAËLA
One word more, this will be the last.
Alas! José, your mother is dying, and she
doesn't want to die without having forgiven you.

JOSÉ
My mother! she's dying?

MICAËLA
Yes. Don José

JOSÉ
Let's go, ah, let's go!
(to Carmen)
Be satisfied! I'm going, but we shall meet
again!
(He hurries off with Micaëla.)

ESCAMILLO (in the distance)
Toreador, on guard! etc.
(José stops at the back, on the rocks. He
hesitates, but, after a moment, goes on his way
with Micaëla. Carmen rushes in the direction of the
voice. The gypsies take up their bales and prepare
to leave.)

ACT FOUR

No. 24 Chorus

A square in Seville
(The the walls of the old arena are in the
background. The entrance to the ring is closed by a
long curtain. A bullfight is about to take place, and
there is great excitement. Hawkers move about
offering water, oranges, fans, etc.)

CHORUS
Two cuartos! Two cuartos!
Fans to cool yourselves!
Oranges to nibble!
Programme with details!
Wine! Water! Cigarettes!
Two cuartos! Two cuartos! etc.
Look! For two cuartos!
Senoras and caballeros!

ZUNIGA
Some oranges, look sharp!

SEVERAL FRUITSELLERS (running up)
Here you are,
take these, ladies.

ONE OF THEM (to Zuniga, who pays)
Thank you, officer, thank you.

THE OTHERS
These ones here, sir, are better.
Fans to cool yourselves, etc.

ZUNIGA
Here you! Some fans!

A GYPSY (running forward)
Want some opera glasses too?

No. 25 March and Chorus

CHORUS
Here they come! Here's the cuadrilla!
The toreadors' cuadrilla!
The sun flashes on their lances!
Up in the air with your caps and hats!
Here they are! Here's the cuadrilla,
the toreadors' cuadrilla!
Here, coming into the square
first of all, marching on foot,
is the constable with his ugly mug!
Down with him! Down with him!
And now as they go by
let's cheer the bold chulos!
Bravo! Hurrah! Glory to courage!
Here come the bold chulos!
Look at the banderilleros!
See what a swaggering air!
See them! See them!
What looks, and how brilliantly
the ornaments glitter
on their fighting dress!
Here are the banderilleros!
Another cuadrilla's coming!
Look at the picadors!

How handsome they are!
How they'll torment the bulls' flanks
with the tips of their lances!
(At last Escamillo appears, accompanied by a
radiant and magnificently dressed Carmen.)
The Matador! Escamillo!
It's the Matador, the skilled swordsman,
he who comes to finish things off,
who appears at the drama's end
and strikes the last blow!
Long live Escamillo! Ah bravo!
Here they are! here's the cuadrilla! etc.

ESCAMILLO (to Carmen)
If you love me, Carmen soon
you can be proud of me.

CARMEN
Ah! I love you, Escamillo, I love you,
and may I die if I have ever loved
anyone as much as you!

TOGETHER
Ah! I love you!
Yes, I love you!

ALGUAZILS
Make way! Make way for his worship the Mayor!
(During a little orchestral march the Mayor enters
and crosses the stage, preceded and followed by
an escort of constables. Meanwhile Frasquita and
Mercédès draw near to Carmen.)

FRASQUITA
Carmen, a word of advice, don't stay here!

CARMEN
And why, if you please?

MERCÉDÈS
He's there!

CARMEN
Who?

MERCÉDÈS
Him, Don José
He's hiding among the crowd; look.

CARMEN
Yes, I see him.

FRASQUITA
Take care!

CARMEN
I'm not a woman to tremble in front of him.
I'm expecting him, and I'll speak to him.

MERCÉDÈS
Carmen, believe me, take care!

CARMEN
I'm not afraid of anything!

FRASQUITA
Take care!
(The mayor's cortege has entered the arena. Behind
him, the procession of the cuadrilla resumes its

march and goes into the ring. The crowd
follows...and in withdrawing has revealed Don José,
leaving him and Carmen alone downstage.)

No. 26 Final Duet

CARMEN
It's you!

JOSÉ
Yes, me!

CARMEN
I'd been warned
that you were about, that you might come here;
I was even told to fear for my life
but I'm no coward and had no intention of running away.

JOSÉ
I'm not threatening, I'm imploring, beseeching;
our past, Carmen - I forget it!
Yes, together we are going
to begin another life,
far from here, under new skies!

CARMEN
You ask the impossible,
Carmen has never lied;
her mind is made up.
Between her and you everything's finished.
I have never lied;
all's over between us.

JOSÉ
Carmen, there is still time,
yes, there is still time.
O my Carmen, let me
save you, you I adore,
and save myself with you!

CARMEN
No, I'm well aware that the hour has come,
I know that you are going to kill me;
but whether I live or die,
no, no, I shall not give in to you!

JOSÉ
Carmen, there is still time,
O my Carmen, let me
save you, you whom I adore;
ah! let me save you
and save myself with you!
O my Carmen, there is still time, etc.

CARMEN
Why still concern yourself
with a heart that's no longer yours?
No, this heart no longer belongs to you!
In vain you say "I adore you"
you'll get nothing, no nothing, from me.
Ah! it's useless,
You'll get nothing, nothing, from me!

JOSÉ
Then you don't love me any more?

(Carmen is silent.)
Then you don't love me any more?

CARMEN
No, I don't love you any more.

JOSÉ
But I, Carmen, I love you still;
Carmen, alas! I adore you!

CARMEN
What's the good of this? What waste of words!

JOSÉ
Carmen, I love you, I adore you!
All right, if I must, to please you
I'll stay a bandit, anything you like -
anything, do you hear? Anything!
but do not leave me,
O my Carmen,
ah! remember the past!
We loved each other once!
Ah! do not leave me, Carmen,
ah, do not leave me!

CARMEN
Carmen will never yield!
Free she was born and free she will die!

CHORUS and FANFARES (in the arena)
Hurrah! hurrah! a grand fight!
Hurrah! Across the bloodstained sand
the bull charges!
Look! Look! Look!
The tormented bull

comes bounding to the attack, look!
Struck true, right to the heart,
look! look! look!
Victory!
(During the chorus, Carmen and José remain
silent...both are listening...José's eyes are fixed
upon her...The chorus over, she takes a step
towards the main entrance of the ring.)

JOSÉ (blocking her way)
Where are you going?

CARMEN
Leave me alone!

JOSÉ
This man they're cheering,
he's your new lover!

CARMEN
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

JOSÉ
By my soul,
you won't get past,
Carmen, you will come with me!

CARMEN
Let me go, Don José, I'm not going with you.

JOSÉ
You're going to him.
Tell me...you love him, then?

CARMEN
I love him!

I love him, and in the face of death itself
I shall go on saying I love him!
(shouts and fanfares again from the arena)

CHORUS
Hurrah! A grand fight! etc.

JOSÉ
So I am to lose
my heart's salvation so that you
can run to him, infamous creature,
to laugh at me in his arms!
No, by my blood, you shall not go!
Carmen, you're coming with me!

CARMEN
No! No! Never!

JOSÉ
I'm tired of threatening you!

CARMEN
All right, stab me then, or let me
pass!

CHORUS
Victory!

JOSÉ
For the last time, you devil,
will you come with me?

CARMEN
No! No!

This ring that you
once gave to me -
here, take it!
(She throws it away.)

JOSÉ
(advancing on Carmen, knife in hand)
All right, damn you!
(Carmen draws back, José following, as fanfares
sound again in the ring.)

CHORUS
Toreador, on guard!
And remember, yes remember as you fight
that two dark eyes are watching you,
and that love awaits you!
(José has stabbed Carmen; she falls dead. The curtains
are thrown open and the crowd comes out of the arena.)

JOSÉ
You can arrest me.
I was the one who killed her!
(Escamillo appears on the arena steps. José
throws himself upon Carmen's body.)
Ah! Carmen! My adored Carmen!
