Overture

ACT ONE

Scene One

The garden of the Commendatore's house. Night.

(Leporello is seen pacing back and forth
in front of the house.)

LEPORELLO
Night and day I slave
for one who does not appreciate it.
I put up with wind and rain,
eat and sleep badly.
I want to be a gentleman
and to give up my servitude.
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I want to give up my servitude.
Oh, what a fine gentleman!
You stay inside with your lady
and I must play the sentinel!
Oh, what a fine gentleman, etc.
But I think someone is coming!
I don't want them to hear me, etc.
(He hides. Enter Don Giovanni and Donna Anna;
she is clinging to his arm.)

DONNA ANNA
There's no hope, unless you kill me,
that I'll ever let you go!

DON GIOVANNI
Idiot! You scream in vain.
Who I am you'll never know!

DONNA ANNA
There's no hope, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
Idiot! etc.

LEPORELLO (to himself)
What a racket! Heaven, what screams!
My master in another scrape.

DONNA ANNA
Help! Everyone! The betrayer!

DON GIOVANNI
Keep quiet! Beware my wrath!

DONNA ANNA
Scoundrel!

DON GIOVANNI
Fool!

DONNA ANNA
Scoundrel!

DON GIOVANNI
Fool!

LEPORELLO (to himself)
We will see if this rascal
will be the ruin of me!

DONNA ANNA
Help! Everyone!

DON GIOVANNI
Keep quiet!

DONNA ANNA
Like a desperate fury
I'll know how to pursue you! etc.
Scoundrel! Help! Everyone!
Like a desperate fury, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
This desperate fury
is aimed at destroying me! etc.
Fool! Keep quiet!
This desperate fury, etc.

LEPORELLO (to himself)
What a racket! Heavens, what screams!
We will see if this rascal, etc.
(Donna Anna, hearing the voice of the
Commendatore, goes into the house.)

COMMENDATORE
Leave her alone, wretch, and defend yourself.

DON GIOVANNI
Go away! I disdain to fight with you.

COMMENDATORE
Thus you think to escape me?

LEPORELLO (to himself)
If I could only get out of here!

DON GIOVANNI
Go away! I disdain you!

COMMENDATORE
Thus you think to escape me?

LEPORELLO (to himself)
If I could only get out of here!

COMMENDATORE
Fight!

DON GIOVANNI
So be it, if you want to die!
(They fight. The Commendatore is mortally wounded.)

COMMENDATORE
Help! I've been betrayed!
The assassin has wounded me!
And from my heaving breast
I see my soul escaping, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
Ah, already the wretch has fallen,
and he gasps for air.
From his heaving breast I already
see his soul escaping, etc.

LEPORELLO
What a misdeed! What a crime!
I can feel my heart
beating hard from fright!
I don't know what to do or say, etc.
(The Commendatore dies.)

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
Leporello, where are you?

LEPORELLO
I'm here, unfortunately, and you?

DON GIOVANNI
Over here.

LEPORELLO
Who's dead, you or the old man?

DON GIOVANNI
What an idiotic question! The old man.

LEPORELLO
Well done! Two misdeeds!
First you raped the daughter then murdered the father!

DON GIOVANNI
It was his own doing: too bad for him.

LEPORELLO
And Donna Anna, did she ask for it too?

DON GIOVANNI
Keep quiet and don't bother me. Now come along,
unless you're anxious for something for yourself.

LEPORELLO
I have no desires, sir, and no more to say.
(They go out. Enter Donna Anna and Don Ottavio,
with servants carrying lights.)

Recitative & Duet

DONNA ANNA
Ah, my father is in danger; let us hurry to help
him.

DON OTTAVIO
I will shed all my blood, if need be. But where is
the scoundrel?

DONNA ANNA
Here...
(She sees the body.)
But ye gods, what is this horrible sight before me?
My father, my dear father!

DON OTTAVIO
My lady!

DONNA ANNA
Ah, the assassin killed him! That blood... the
wound... his face, the colour of death! He no
longer breathes... his limbs are cold. My father!
Beloved father! I'm fainting! I'm dying!

(She faints.)

DON OTTAVIO
Help my beloved, friends! Find and bring some
smelling salts or some cordial! Do not delay!
(The servants depart on their errand.)
Donna Anna! My bride! My beloved!
She is dying of grief!

DONNA ANNA
Ah!

DON OTTAVIO
She is coming to!
(The servants return.)
Help her up.

DONNA ANNA
My father!

DON OTTAVIO
Hide it, remove that object of horror
from her gaze.
(The servants carry away the body.)
My beloved, be consoled! Take heart.

DONNA ANNA
Go away, cruel man, go away!
Let me die, too,
now that he is dead, oh God,
he who gave me life!

DON OTTAVIO
Listen, beloved, please listen!
Look at me one moment only!
Your beloved speaks to you,
he who lives only for you!

DONNA ANNA
It is you - forgive me, my love -
my grief, my distress...
Ah, where is my father?

DON OTTAVIO
Your father? Banish, my dear,
this bitter memory.
You have a husband and father in me.

DONNA ANNA
Ah, where is my father?

DON OTTAVIO
Banish, my dear, etc.

DONNA ANNA
Ah, swear to revenge his blood,
if you can.

DON OTTAVIO
I swear, I swear,
I swear it upon your eyes,
I swear it upon our love!

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
What an oath, ye gods,
what a terrible moment!

My hear t is stirred
by countless seething emotions, etc.

DONNA ANNA
Swear to revenge his blood!

DON OTTAVIO
I swear it upon your eyes, upon our love!

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
What an oath, ye gods! etc.
(They go out.)

Scene Two

A street near an inn. Early morning.

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
Come on now, hurry up. What do you want?

LEPORELLO
It's a very important matter.

DON GIOVANNI
I believe you.

LEPORELLO
Most impor tant.

DON GIOVANNI
So much the better. Out with it.

LEPORELLO
Promise you won't become angry.

DON GIOVANNI
I swear it on my honour, as long as you don't
speak of the Commendatore.

LEPORELLO
Are we alone?

DON GIOVANNI
You can see that.

LEPORELLO
No one can hear us?

DON GIOVANNI
Come on!

LEPORELLO
May I tell you everything freely?

DON GIOVANNI
Yes.

LEPORELLO
Well then, my dear master, the life you are leading
is that of a knave!

DON GIOVANNI
Rascal, you dare...

LEPORELLO
And your oath?

DON GIOVANNI
I know nothing about oaths. Keep quiet or I'll...

LEPORELLO
I have no more to say, not even a whisper, my dear master.

DON GIOVANNI
That way we'll remain friends. Now listen, do you
know why I am here?

LEPORELLO
I don't know anything. But since it is nearly dawn,
could it be some new conquest? I must know, so I
may add it to the list.

DON GIOVANNI
Go on, but you're a fine one! Then you must know
that I love a beautiful lady and I am certain she
loves me. I saw and spoke to her. She will come
tonight to the villa with me.
Quiet! I think I sniff a woman!

LEPORELLO (aside)
My, what a perfect sense of smell!

DON GIOVANNI
I think she's attractive.

LEPORELLO (aside)
And what an eye!

DON GIOVANNI
Let us hide for a while and see which way the land lies.

LEPORELLO (aside)
He's already excited!
(They hide. Donna Elvira enters.)

Aria

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, who is there who will tell me
where the rascal is
whom, to my shame, I loved
and who betrayed me?
Ah, if I can find the villain
and he will not come back to me,
I will make a horrible example of him.
I will tear out his heart!

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Did you hear that? Some beauty
abandoned by her lover.

DONNA ELVIRA
I will make a horrible example of him.
I will tear out his heart!

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Poor girl!

DONNA ELVIRA
I will tear out his heart, etc.

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Let us try to console her grief.

LEPORELLO (aside)
Thus he has consoled eighteen hundred.

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, who is there who will tell me, etc.

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Poor girl!

DONNA ELVIRA
I will tear his heart out, etc.

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Let us try, etc.

LEPORELLO (aside)
Thus he has consoled, etc.

DONNA ELVIRA
I will tear his heart out, etc.
(Don Giovanni steps forward.)

DON GIOVANNI
My lady!

Recitative

DONNA ELVIRA
Who's there?

DON GIOVANNI
Good heavens! What's this?

LEPORELLO (a parte)
Oh wonderful! Donna Elvira!

DONNA ELVIRA
Don Giovanni! You here, you monster, you criminal,
you pack of lies!

LEPORELLO (aside)
What becoming titles! It's lucky she knows him well.

DON GIOVANNI
Come, my dear Donna Elvira, calm yourself. Listen.
Let me speak.

DONNA ELVIRA
What can you say, after so black a deed? You
sneaked into my house, and by your artistry, your
promises and your sighs, you succeeded in
seducing me. I fell in love, oh cruel one, and you
declared me your bride. Then contrary to all the
laws of ear th and Heaven, after three days you
fled Burgos, abandoned me, and left me a prey to
remorse and to weeping, perhaps as a punishment
for having loved you so much!

LEPORELLO (aside)
She sounds like a book!

DON GIOVANNI
Oh, as for that, I had my reasons, didn't I?

LEPORELLO
Oh yes, and what good reasons!

DONNA ELVIRA
And what were they, if not your perfidy, your
fickleness? But just Heaven wanted me to find
you, to carry out its, my vengeance.

DON GIOVANNI
Come now, be more reasonable!
(aside)
This woman is a nuisance!
(to Elvira)
If you don't believe what I say, then believe this
gentleman here.

LEPORELLO (aside)
Anything but the truth.

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Go on, tell her.

LEPORELLO (aside to Don Giovanni)
And what shall I tell her?

DON GIOVANNI
Yes, yes, tell her anything.

DONNA ELVIRA
(to Leporello, while Don Giovanni slips away
unnoticed by Donna Elvira)
All right, but hurry up.

LEPORELLO
Madam - really - in this world, when it happens
that a square is not a circle...

DONNA ELVIRA
Wretch! Thus you mock my grief? Ah, you -
(turning to address Don Giovanni)
Good Heavens! The villain has fled! Alas, where
could he be? Where?

LEPORELLO
Oh, let him go. He doesn't deserve to be worried
over.

DONNA ELVIRA
The wretch tricked me, betrayed me...

LEPORELLO
Calm yourself! You are not, were not and will not
be either the first or the last. Look: this fat little
book is entirely full of the names of his
sweethearts. Each town, each district, each
countryside testifies to his affairs with women.

Aria

My dear lady, this is a list
of the beauties my master has loved,
a list which I have compiled.
Observe, read along with me.
In Italy, six hundred and forty;
in Germany, two hundred and thirty-one;
a hundred in France; in Turkey ninety-one.
In Spain already one thousand and three.
Among these are peasant girls,
maidservants, city girls,
countesses, baronesses,

marchionesses, princesses,
women of every rank,
every shape, every age.
In Italy six hundred and forty, etc.
With blondes it is his habit
to praise their kindness;
in brunettes, their faithfulness;
in the very blonde, their sweetness.
In winter he likes fat ones,
in summer he likes thin ones.
He calls the tall ones majestic.
The little ones are always charming.
He seduces the old ones
for the pleasure of adding to the list.
His greatest favourite
is the young beginner.
It doesn't matter if she's rich,
ugly or beautiful;
if she is rich, ugly or beautiful.
If she wears a petticoat,
you know what he does.
If she wears a petticoat, etc.
(He leaves.)

Recitative

DONNA ELVIRA
These are the tricks the villain has used to betray
me; is this the reward the barbarian returns for my
love? Ah, I must get revenge for my deceived
heart: before he escapes - returns - makes off - I
hear only bloody revenge speaking within me, only
fury and hate.
(She goes off.)

Scene Three

The open country near Don Giovanni's house.
Morning.

(Zerlina, Masetto, and peasants are singing and dancing.)

Chorus

ZERLINA
You girls who trifle with love,
do not let the time pass you by!
If in your breasts your hearts are fluttering,
here is the cure, as you can see! Ah!
What a joy, what a joy it will be!

PEASANT GIRLS
Ah! What a joy, what a joy it will be!
La la la, etc.

MASETTO
You light-hearted young men,
don't go wandering here and there.
A fool's holiday is very short,
but for me it has not yet begun. Ah!
What a joy, what a joy it will be!

PEASANT LADS
Ah, what a joy, etc.
La la la, etc.

ZERLINA, MASETTO
Come, my dear, let's enjoy ourselves
and sing, dance and play!

Come, my dear, let's enjoy ourselves,
what a joy, what a joy it will be! etc.
What a joy, etc.

ALL
Ah, what a joy, etc.
La la la lera, etc.
(Don Giovanni and Leporello enter.)

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
Well, at last she is gone. Oh look, what handsome
young people, and what lovely women!

LEPORELLO (aside)
Among so many, by my faith there ought to be one
for me, too.

DON GIOVANNI
My dear friends, good morning. Go on enjoying
yourselves, go on playing, my good people. Is there
a wedding?

ZERLINA
Yes, sir, and I am the bride.

DON GIOVANNI
I am happy to hear it. And the groom?

MASETTO
I am he, at your service.

DON GIOVANNI
Well spoken. At my service - this is the way a real
gentleman talks.

LEPORELLO (aside)
It's quite enough he should be a good husband.

ZERLINA
Oh, my Masetto has a very good heart.

DON GIOVANNI
And I, too, you see. I want to be your friend. Your
name?

ZERLINA
Zerlina.

DON GIOVANNI
And yours?

MASETTO
Masetto.

DON GIOVANNI
Oh, my dear Masetto! And my dear Zerlina! I offer
you my protection.
(to Leporello, who is flirting with the girls)
Leporello, what are you doing there, you rascal?

LEPORELLO
I, too, dear master, am offering my protection.

DON GIOVANNI
Hurry, go with them. Take them at once to my villa.
See that they are served chocolate, coffee, wines,
and hams. Try to keep them all amused; show
them the garden, the gallery, the rooms. Be sure
that my dear Masetto is made happy. Do you understand?

LEPORELLO
I understand. Let's go!

MASETTO
Sir!

DON GIOVANNI
What is it?

MASETTO
Zerlina cannot stay here without me.

LEPORELLO
His Excellency will take your place, and he will
know how to fill your shoes.

DON GIOVANNI
Oh, Zerlina is in the hands of a cavalier. Go on;
she and I will come later.

ZERLINA
Go on, don't worry. I am in the hands of a cavalier.

MASETTO
And that means?

ZERLINA
And that means there is nothing to worry about.

MASETTO
And I, by heaven...

DON GIOVANNI
Hey there, let's end this bickering! If you don't
leave us at once, Masetto, be careful, you'll regret it!
(He taps his sword significantly.)

Aria

MASETTO
I understand, yes sir, I do.
I bow my head and go away.
Since this is the way you want it,
I make no objections.
No no, no, no objections.
After all you are a cavalier,
and I really must not doubt you.
I am reassured by the kindness
which you want to show me.
(aside to Zerlina)
You nasty little witch!
You always were my ruin!
(to Leporello)
I'm coming, I'm coming.
(to Zerlina)
Stay here, stay here.
It's a very innocent affair!
Perhaps this cavalier
will make you a lady.

You nasty little witch!
You always, etc.
(He goes out, accompanied by Leporello and the peasants.)

Recitative & Duettino

DON GIOVANNI
At last we are free, my dearest Zerlina, of that
boor. Tell me, my dear, didn't I handle it neatly?

ZERLINA
Sir, he is my husband.

DON GIOVANNI
Who? That one? Do you suppose an honourable
man, a noble cavalier, as I believe myself to be,
could permit such a lovely little face, such sweet
beauty to be stolen by a clumsy oaf?

ZERLINA
But, sir, I promised to marry him.

DON GIOVANNI
That kind of promise means nothing. You were not
made to be a peasant girl. Another fate is called
for by those roguish eyes, those lovely lips, those
slender, perfumed fingers, so soft to the touch and
smelling of roses.

ZERLINA
Ah, but I do not wish...

DON GIOVANNI
What don't you wish?

ZERLINA
To be deceived in the end. I know that you
cavaliers are only rarely honest and sincere with women.

DON GIOVANNI
Oh, a mere slander spread by common folk. True
nobility can be seen in the honesty of one's eyes.
Come now, let's not waste time. I want to marry
you on the spot.

ZERLINA
You?

DON GIOVANNI
Of course. That little villa there is mine, and there,
my jewel, we will be married.
There you will give me your hand,
there you will tell me "yes".
You see, it is not far;
Let us leave, my beloved.

ZERLINA
I'd like to, but yet I would not.
My heart trembles a little.
It's true I would be happy,
but he may just be tricking me.

DON GIOVANNI
Come, my dearly beloved!

ZERLINA
I'm sorry for Masetto.

DON GIOVANNI
I will change your life!

ZERLINA
Soon I won't be able to resist.

DON GIOVANNI
Come! Come!
There you will give me your hand.

ZERLINA
I'd like to, but yet I would not.

DON GIOVANNI
There you will tell me "yes".

ZERLINA
My heart trembles a little.

DON GIOVANNI
Let us leave, my beloved.

ZERLINA
But he may just be tricking me.

DON GIOVANNI
Come, my dearly beloved!

ZERLINA
I'm sorry for Masetto.

DON GIOVANNI
I will change your life.

ZERLINA
Soon I won't be able to resist.

DON GIOVANNI
Let us go!

ZERLINA
Let us go!

DON GIOVANNI, ZERLINA
Let us go, let us go, my beloved,
to soothe the pangs
of an innocent love, etc.
(Donna Elvira enters.)

Recitative

DONNA ELVIRA
Stop, villain! Heaven willed that I should overhear
your lies. I am in time to save this innocent from
your dreadful scheming.

ZERLINA
Poor me! What's this I hear?

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
Love, come to my aid!
(to Donna Elvira)
My dear woman, can't you see that I want to enjoy myself?

DONNA ELVIRA
Enjoy yourself! It's true! Enjoy yourself? I know,
cruel one, how you enjoy yourself!

ZERLINA
But, your lordship, is it true what she is saying?

DON GIOVANNI (aside to Zerlina)
The poor woman is in love with me,
and out of pity I must pretend to love her,
for it is my misfortune
to have a kind heart.

Aria

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, flee the traitor!
Don't listen to what he says!
His lips are lying ones,
his eyes deceiving.
Learn from my suffering
to trust what I say,
and let my misfortune
make you afraid.
Ah, flee!
Ah, flee the traitor, etc.
Don't listen to what he says, etc.
(She leaves with Zerlina.)

Recitative & Quartet

DON GIOVANNI
It seems the devil must be amusing himself at my
expense today. Everything is going badly.

(Donna Anna and Don Ottavio enter.)

DON OTTAVIO
Ah now, beloved, that tears are in vain, let us talk
of vengeance. Ah, Don Giovanni!

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
This is all I needed!

DONNA ANNA
Friend, we find you in time. Do you have a heart, a
generous nature?

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
Now we'll see that the devil will have told her
something.
(to Donna Anna)
What a question! Why?

DONNA ANNA
We need your friendship.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
I breathe again.
(to Donna Anna)
At your service. My relatives, my parents, this arm,
this sword, my possessions, my blood, all I will
give to serve you. But, Donna Anna, why do you
weep thus? Who was the cruel one who dared to
trouble your peace of mind?
(Donna Elvira returns.)

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, I've found you again, faithless monster!
Do not believe, unhappy one,
in that faithless heart!
The villain has already betrayed me!
Now he seeks to betray you.

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
Heavens, what noble bearing,
what sweet majesty!
Her pallor, her tears
fill me with pity!

DON GIOVANNI
The poor girl is mad, my friends,
leave me alone with her,
she's mad, my friends.
(aside)
Perhaps she will calm down.

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, do not believe the faithless one!

DON GIOVANNI
She's mad, pay no attention.

DONNA ELVIRA
Stay, for Heaven's sake, stay!

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
In whom should we believe?

DON GIOVANNI
She's mad!

DONNA ELVIRA
Stay!

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
In whom should we believe?

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah! Do not believe the faithless one! Stay!

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO, DON GIOVANNI
A feeling of strange import...

DONNA ELVIRA
Scorn, rage, disdain and fear...

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO, DON GIOVANNI
...stir within my breast.

DONNA ELVIRA
...stir within my breast.

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO DON GIOVANNI
They tell me of this poor woman
a hundred things I cannot yet grasp, etc.

DONNA ELVIRA
They tell me of his betrayer
a hundred things I cannot yet grasp, etc.

DON OTTAVIO (aside)
I will not leave here
until I find out the truth.

DONNA ANNA (aside)
There is no sign of madness
in her manner, in her speech.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
If I should go, they might
suspect something.

DONNA ELVIRA
From his expression they should
be able to estimate his bad character.

DON OTTAVIO (to Don Giovanni)
So then she -

DON GIOVANNI
Is a little mad.

DONNA ANNA (to Donna Elvira)
So then he -

DONNA ELVIRA
Is a betrayer.

DON GIOVANNI
Poor woman!

DONNA ELVIRA
Liar! Liar! Liar!

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
I'm beginning to suspect.

DON GIOVANNI (to Donna Elvira)
Softly, softly. People
are beginning to gather around us.
Be a little more prudent,
you will become an object of gossip.

DONNA ELVIRA (loudly to Don Giovanni)
Don't place your hopes there, villain,
I have lost my sense of modesty!
Your guilt and my situation
shall be known to all.
Don't place your hopes, etc.

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO (aside)
Those whispered undertones,
that constant blushing,
are all too clear an indication
and banish all my doubts, etc.

DON GIOVANNI (to Donna Elvira)
Softly, softly. People, etc.
(Donna Elvira goes off.)

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
Unfortunate woman! I must follow her. I don't want
her to do anything rash. Excuse me, most beautiful
Donna Anna. If I may be of service to you I await
you in my house. My friends, farewell.
(He leaves hurriedly.)

Recitative & Aria

DONNA ANNA
Don Ottavio, I shall die!

DON OTTAVIO
What is it?

DONNA ANNA
For pity's sake, help me!

DON OTTAVIO
My beloved, take hear t!

DONNA ANNA
O ye gods! O ye gods! That man is my father's murderer!

DON OTTAVIO
What are you saying?

DONNA ANNA
There is no doubt about it. The parting words the
villain uttered, his whole voice recalled to my heart
that worthless creature who, in my apartment...

DON OTTAVIO
Oh heaven! Is it possible that beneath the sacred
cloak of friendship...? But how was it? Tell me
about the strange happening.

DONNA ANNA
It was already quite late when into my rooms,
where I unluckily happened to be alone, I saw a
man enter, wrapped in a cloak. At first I mistook
him for you, but then I realised that I was
mistaken.

DON OTTAVIO
Good Lord! Continue!

DONNA ANNA
Silently he approached me and tried to embrace
me. I tried to free myself but he seized me all the
harder. I screamed, but no one came! With one
hand he tried to quiet me, and with the other he
seized me so hard that I already thought myself lost.

DON OTTAVIO
The scoundrel! And then?

DONNA ANNA
Finally my despair, my horror of the deed so
strengthened me that by dint of twisting, turning
and bending I freed myself of him!

DON OTTAVIO
Ah me, I breathe again!

DONNA ANNA
Then I redoubled my screams for help. The felon
fled. Quickly I followed him as far as the street in
order to catch him, becoming in my turn the
pursuer. My father ran out, wanted to learn his
identity, and the rascal, who was stronger than the
old man, completed his misdeed by murdering him!
Now you know who tried
to steal my honour from me,
who was the betrayer
who took my father's life.
I ask you for vengeance.
Your heart asks for it, too.
Remember the wound
in the poor man's breast,
the ground all around
covered with blood,
if ever in your heart
your just anger weakens.
Now you know who tried, etc.
I ask you for vengeance, etc.
(She leaves.)

Recitative & Aria

DON OTTAVIO
How can I believe that a nobleman could be guilty
of so black a crime! Ah, I must get at the truth any
way I can. I feel that as a friend and lover my duty
is plain: I must either undeceive her or avenge her.

Upon her peace of mind
mine also depends;
what pleases her
is what gives me life,
what displeases her
is what gives me death.
If she sighs,
then I, too, must sigh.
Her anger becomes my own.
Her tears belong to me.
And there can be no joy for me
if she is not happy.
Upon her peace of mind, etc.
(He leaves.)

(Enter Leporello, then Don Giovanni.)

Recitative

LEPORELLO
I must find some way to leave this fine lunatic.
There he is now. Look at the indifference with
which he comes.

DON GIOVANNI
Oh, my dear Leporello, is everything going well?

LEPORELLO
My dear Don Giovanni, everything is going badly.

DON GIOVANNI
What do you mean, everything is going badly?

LEPORELLO
I went home, as you told me to, with all those
people.

DON GIOVANNI
Well done!

LEPORELLO
By chattering, flattery and lies,
tricks I picked up from you,
I tried to detain them.

DON GIOVANNI
Bravo!

LEPORELLO
I told Masetto a thousand lies in order to free his
mind of jealous thoughts.

DON GIOVANNI
Well done, on my oath!

LEPORELLO
I saw to it that both the men and the women
drank. They soon became intoxicated. Some sang,
some joked, others continued to drink. At the
height of it all, guess who dropped in?

DON GIOVANNI
Zerlina?

LEPORELLO
Right! And who was with her?

DON GIOVANNI
Donna Elvira!

LEPORELLO
Right! And she said about you -

DON GIOVANNI
Everything bad she could think of.

LEPORELLO
Right, on my oath.

DON GIOVANNI
And what did you do?

LEPORELLO
I kept quiet.

DON GIOVANNI
And she?

LEPORELLO
She went right on screaming.

DON GIOVANNI
And then you... ?

LEPORELLO
When I guessed she had finished, I quietly led her
out and skilfully locked the door in her face,
leaving her alone in the street.

DON GIOVANNI
Well done, excellently done! The affair could not be
going better. You began it, I will finish it. These
lusty peasant lasses are too much on my mind. I
want to amuse them until night comes.

Aria

So that the wine
may set their heads whirling,
go and prepare
a wonderful party.
If on the way
you meet some young lady,
try also to bring
her along.
Let the dancing
be spontaneous.
They can do the minuet,
the gavotte
or the waltz,
just as you like.
And I in the meantime
behind the scenes
will be flir ting
with this one and that one.
Ah, to my list
tomorrow morning
you will have to add
at least ten names! etc.
(They depart.)

Scene Four

A garden outside Don Giovanni's house
(Zerlina, Masetto and peasants)

Recitative

ZERLINA
Masetto, listen to me. Masetto, I say.

MASETTO
Don't touch me.

ZERLINA
Why?

MASETTO
You ask me why? Cheat! Why should I let a hussy
like you touch me?

ZERLINA
Ah, no! Don't speak that way, cruel man. I don't
deserve such treatment from you.

MASETTO
What? You have the effrontery to make excuses?
To remain alone with a man, abandoning me on my
wedding day! To shame an honest working man in
such a manner! Ah, if it were not for the scandal I
would like to -
(The peasants leave.)

ZERLINA
But if I am not to blame? If I have been tricked by
him? And then, what do you fear? Calm yourself,
my love; he did not touch even the tips of my
fingers. You don't believe it? Ungrateful one! Come
here! Vent your anger! Kill me! Do everything you
want to me, but afterwards, my Masetto, let us
make peace.

Aria

Beat me, beat me, my Masetto,
beat your poor Zerlina.
I'll stay here like a lamb
and await your every blow.
Beat me, beat me, etc.
I'll let you pull my hair out,
I'll let you gouge my eyes out,
and then happily I will kiss
your wonderfully sweet hands.
Beat me, beat me, etc.
Ah, I see you have no heart!
Let's make up, my own true love.
In happiness and joy
we must pass the days and nights,
yes, each day and every night, etc.
Let's make up, my own true love, etc.

Recitative

MASETTO
See how this little witch knew how to get around
me! We must be weak in the head!

DON GIOVANNI (offstage)
Get everything ready for a big celebration.

ZERLINA
Ah, Masetto, Masetto, that's the voice of his
lordship the cavalier!

MASETTO
Well then, what of it?

ZERLINA
He's coming!

MASETTO
Let him come.

ZERLINA
Ah, if there were only some place to hide!

MASETTO
What are you afraid of? Why do you grow pale? Ah,
I understand, you hussy! You fear that I will learn
how things went between you two.

Finale

MASETTO
Hurry, hurry, before he comes
I must hide somewhere:
there's a nook off to one side
where I can stay and remain quiet.

ZERLINA
Listen, listen! Where are you going?
Do not hide here, oh Masetto!
If he finds you, woe is you.
You don't know what he might do.

MASETTO
Let him do or say what he pleases.

ZERLINA
Your brave words mean nothing!

MASETTO
Speak up and stay here.

ZERLINA (aside)
What could he have in mind?

MASETTO
Speak up, and stay here.
(aside)
I will learn if she is faithful,
and how the affair went, etc.

ZERLINA (aside)
The ungrateful, cruel man
wants to cause a crisis now, etc.
(Masetto hides. Don Giovanni enters, followed by a
group of servants. The peasants return.)

DON GIOVANNI
Come, wake up ever ybody!
Come, courage, my good people!
We want to have a good time,
we want to laugh and joke.

To the ballroom
now lead everybody
and see to it that
refreshments are served in plenty.

CHORUS
Come, wake up, ever ybody, etc.
(The servants and the peasants go out. Zerlina is
looking for a place to hide.)

ZERLINA
Among these bushes
perhaps he won't see me.

DON GIOVANNI
Zerlina, my lovely,
I've seen you; don't run away!

ZERLINA
Oh please let me go!

DON GIOVANNI
No, no, stay, joy of my life!

ZERLINA
If there's pity in your heart -

DON GIOVANNI
Yes, my dear, I'm full of love.
Come over here for just a moment;
I want to make you happy.
Come over here for just a moment, etc.

ZERLINA (aside)
Oh, if he sees my husband,
I know well what he will do.
(Don Giovanni pulls Zerlina away but coming face
to face with Masetto, stops in amazement.)

DON GIOVANNI
Masetto?

MASETTO
Yes, Masetto.

DON GIOVANNI
Hiding in there? What for?
Your beautiful Zerlina
cannot, poor girl, stay
any longer without you.

MASETTO
I understand, sir, indeed I do.

DON GIOVANNI
Now cheer up, both of you,
do you hear the musicians?
Now come along with me.

ZERLINA, MASETTO
Yes, yes, let us cheer up,
and go and dance with the others,
all three of us, etc.
(They go out. Don Ottavio, Donna Anna and Donna
Elvira enter together. They are masked.)

DONNA ELVIRA
We must be brave,
my dear friends,
and thus we shall be able
to uncover his misdeeds.

DON OTTAVIO
Our friend is right,
we must be brave.
Banish, my darling,
your anguish and fear.

DONNA ANNA
The step is a dangerous one;
there could be dire results.
I fear for my beloved,
and for us all.
(Leporello opens a window.)

LEPORELLO (to Don Giovanni)
Sir, look for a moment
at this handsome masked trio!

DON GIOVANNI (at the window)
Have them come in,
tell them they honour us.

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
(aside)
His looks and his voice
reveal the betrayer.

LEPORELLO
Psst! Masqueraders! Psst!

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA (to Don Ottavio)
Go on, answer him.

LEPORELLO
Psst, psst! Masqueraders!

DON OTTAVIO
What do you want?

LEPORELLO
If you would care to enter,
my master invites you to the dance.

DON OTTAVIO
You do us an honour!
Let us go, my dear friends.

LEPORELLO (aside)
Our friend will also
try his hand on these.
(He retires from the window.)

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
May just Heaven protect
my determined heart! etc.

DONNA ELVIRA
May just Heaven avenge
my betrayed love! etc.
(They leave.)

Scene Five

A ballroom in Don Giovanni's house
(Don Giovanni escorts some girls to their places.
Leporello is chatting to some of the men.)

DON GIOVANNI
Take a rest, my pretty ones.

LEPORELLO
Refresh yourselves, my brave lads.

DON GIOVANNI, LEPORELLO
You will soon be dancing again.
You will soon be joking again.

DON GIOVANNI (to the servants)
Hey there, coffee!

LEPORELLO
Chocolate!

MASETTO (to Zerlina)
Oh, Zerlina, be careful!

DON GIOVANNI
Ices!

LEPORELLO
Sweets!

MASETTO
Oh, Zerlina, be careful!

ZERLINA, MASETTO (aside)
The scene has begun too sweetly;
the ending could be bitter.

DON GIOVANNI
You are lovely, my gorgeous Zerlina.

ZERLINA
You are too kind.

MASETTO (aside)
She's lapping it up!

LEPORELLO (to the girls)
You are so nice, Gianotta, Sandrina!

MASETTO (aside)
Go on and touch her, so I can lop off your head!

ZERLINA
Masetto looks out of his mind.
This is getting worse all the time, etc.

DON GIOVANNI, LEPORELLO
Masetto looks out of his mind.
Now we'd better use our heads, etc.

MASETTO
She's lapping it up!
Go on and touch her, so I can lop off your head!
Ah, flirt, you're driving me to distraction, etc.
(Donna Anna, Donna Elvira and Don Ottavio now
enter, still masked.)

LEPORELLO
Come forward, come forward,
my gracious masqueraders!

DON GIOVANNI
Everyone is welcome!
Hurray for freedom!

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
We thank you for so many signs
of boundless generosity.

ALL
Hurray for freedom! etc.

DON GIOVANNI (to the musicians)
Resume your playing!
(to Leporello)
You, pair off the dancers.

LEPORELLO
Now everyone dance!
(They dance.)

DONNA ELVIRA (to Donna Anna)
That's the peasant girl.

DONNA ANNA
I'm dying!

DON OTTAVIO
Hide your feelings!

DON GIOVANNI, LEPORELLO
It's really going well!

MASETTO (sarcastically)
It's really going well!

DON GIOVANNI (to Leporello)
Keep your eye on Masetto.

LEPORELLO (to Masetto)
You're not dancing, poor boy?
Come here, my dear Masetto,
let us do what the others are doing.

DON GIOVANNI (to Zerlina)
I am your partner.
Zerlina, come this way.

MASETTO
No, no, I don't want to dance.

LEPORELLO
Come, my friend, let's dance!

MASETTO
No!

LEPORELLO
Yes, dear Masetto!

DONNA ANNA
I can't stand it!

DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
Pretend, for pity's sake!

LEPORELLO
Dance!

MASETTO
No, no, I don't want to.

LEPORELLO
Now dance, my friend!
Let us do what the others are doing.
(Leporello dances with Masetto. Don Giovanni,
dancing with Zerlina, leads her towards an exit.)

DON GIOVANNI
Come with me, my own! Come!

MASETTO
Leave me alone! Ah no! Zerlina!

ZERLINA
Ye powers! I am lost!
(Don Giovanni and Zerlina go off into another room.)

LEPORELLO
This will be a disaster!
(He leaves hastily after them.)

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
The scoundrel draws a noose
around his own neck!

ZERLINA (offstage)
Help, everyone, help!

DONNA ELVIRA, DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
Let us rescue the innocent girl!

MASETTO
Ah, Zerlina!

ZERLINA (offstage)
Scoundrel!

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
Now she's screaming from over there!

ZERLINA (offstage)
Scoundrel!

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
Let us break down the door!

ZERLINA (offstage)
Save me! Ah save me, or I am lost!

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
We are here to help you!
(Don Giovanni, sword in hand, re-enters dragging
Leporello with him.)

DON GIOVANNI
Here's the lout who did it!
But I will punish him!
Die, I say!

LEPORELLO
What are you doing?

DON GIOVANNI
Die, I say!

LEPORELLO
What are you doing?

DON GIOVANNI
Die, I say!

LEPORELLO
What are you doing?

DON OTTAVIO
(to Don Giovanni, pistol in hand)
Don't try to trick us!

DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO
The villain thinks his trick
will serve to hide his villainy!
(They take off their masks.)

DON GIOVANNI
Donna Elvira!

DONNA ELVIRA
Yes, monster!

DON GIOVANNI
Don Ottavio!

DON OTTAVIO
Yes, sir!

DON GIOVANNI
You must believe -

ALL except DON GIOVANNI and LEPORELLO
Traitor!
We know everything! etc.
Tremble, tremble, scoundrel!
Now the whole world shall know
of the horrible, black crime
of your arrogant cruelty!
Listen to the sound of vengeance
as it thunders all around you!
Upon your head this very day
its thunderbolt shall fall.

LEPORELLO
His head is whirling in confusion,
he no longer knows what's happening.
A dreadful storm, oh Lord,
its thundering over him.
But he does not lack for courage.
He is not lost or worried.
If the world itself should end,
nothing could make him afraid.

DON GIOVANNI
My head is whirling in confusion,
I no longer know what's happening.
A dreadful storm, oh Lord,
is thundering above me.
But I do not lack courage.
I am not lost or worried.
If the world itself should end,
nothing could make me afraid.

(Exit Don Giovanni.)

ACT TWO

Scene One

A street near an inn. Night.

Duet

DON GIOVANNI
Go on, clown, don't annoy me!

LEPORELLO
No, no, master, I won't stay!

DON GIOVANNI
Listen, my friend -

LEPORELLO
I want to go, I tell you!

DON GIOVANNI
But what have I done to you
that you want to leave me?

LEPORELLO
O, nothing at all.
You almost killed me.

DON GIOVANNI
Go on, you are mad!
It was only a joke.

LEPORELLO
And I am not joking.
I want to go.
(Leporello starts to go.)

DON GIOVANNI
Go on, clown, etc.

LEPORELLO
No, no, master, etc.

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
Leporello!

LEPORELLO
Sir?

DON GIOVANNI (offering him money)
Come here! Let's make up. Here.

LEPORELLO
What is it?

DON GIOVANNI
Four pistoles.

LEPORELLO (taking the money)
Oh, well, then, this time I yield, but don't make a
habit of it. Don't think you can get around me as
you do with your women, not even with money.

DON GIOVANNI
Let's talk no more about it. Have you the nerve to
do what I tell you?

LEPORELLO
As long as we leave the women alone.

DON GIOVANNI
Leave the women alone? You're mad! You know
that they are more necessary to me than the
bread I eat! Than the air I breathe!

LEPORELLO
Do you have the gall, then, to betray them all?

DON GIOVANNI
Love is much the same in any form. He who
remains faithful to one is being cruel to the others;
I, who have an overabundance of sentiment, love
them all. Since women cannot think clearly, they
call my natural, kindly feelings betrayal.

LEPORELLO
I have never come across kindness more
abundantly dispensed! Now then, what is it you
want me to do?

DON GIOVANNI
Listen! Have you seen Donna Elvira's little maid?

LEPORELLO
I? No.

DON GIOVANNI
Then you have missed something, my dear
Leporello. Now I want to try out my luck with her,
and I thought, since it is almost evening, that I
would whet her appetite all the more by presenting
myself disguised in your clothes.

LEPORELLO
And why couldn't you present yourself in your own clothes?

DON GIOVANNI
A nobleman's clothes are not very popular among
people of her class.
(He removes his cloak.)
Come on, hurry up!

LEPORELLO
Sir, for more than one reason -

DON GIOVANNI
Keep quiet! I can't stand being argued with!
(They exchange cloaks and hats. Donna Elvira
appears at a window of the inn.)

Trio

DONNA ELVIRA
Keep still, unjust heart!
Do not beat so within my breast!
He is a villain, a betrayer,
and it is wrong to feel pity.

LEPORELLO
Quiet! I hear, sir,
Donna Elvira's voice!

DON GIOVANNI
I want to seize my opportunity.
You stand there!
(He stands behind Leporello and speaks for him,
making appropriate gestures with his servant's arms.)
Elvira, my beloved!

DONNA ELVIRA
Is it the ingrate?

DON GIOVANNI
Yes, my own, it is I,
and I beg for your mercy.

DONNA ELVIRA
Lord, what a strange feeling
awakens in my breast!

LEPORELLO
Wait and see, this madwoman
will still believe what he says!

DON GIOVANNI
Come down here, my lovely,
you will see you are the one
whom my soul adores.
I am really penitent.

DONNA ELVIRA
No, I don't believe you, cruel one! etc.

DON GIOVANNI
0 believe me, or I'll kill myself!
My darling, please come here! etc.

LEPORELLO (to Don Giovanni)
If you go on, I'll laugh! etc.

DONNA ELVIRA
What a quandary is this!
1 don't know what to do!
Oh Lord, please protect
my credulous heart, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
I hope she yields to me quickly!
What a nice little coup this is!
Nowhere have I found
as fertile a talent as mine! etc.

LEPORELLO
Already those lying lips
are again seducing this poor woman;
oh gods, protect her
from her own credulous heart! etc.
(Donna Elvira disappears from the window.)

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
My friend, what do you think?

LEPORELLO
I think you have a soul of bronze!

DON GIOVANNI
Go on, what a buffoon you are! Now listen closely:
when she comes out, you run to embrace her, give
her a caress or two, imitate my voice. Then skilfully
try to lead her away with you.

LEPORELLO
But, sir -

DON GIOVANNI
No more arguments!

LEPORELLO
And if she recognises me?

DON GIOVANNI
She won't recognise you if you are careful. Quiet,
she's coming! Careful!
(Don Giovanni hides to one side. Donna Elvira enters.)

DONNA ELVIRA
Here I am.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
Let's see what she does.

LEPORELLO (aside)
What a mess!

DONNA ELVIRA
So then, can I believe that my tears have won over
your heart? That, penitent, my beloved Don
Giovanni returns to his duty and to my love?

LEPORELLO
Yes, my dear!

DONNA ELVIRA
Cruel one, if you knew how many tears and sighs
you cost me!

LEPORELLO
I, my own?

DONNA ELVIRA
You.

LEPORELLO
Poor girl, how sorry I am!

DONNA ELVIRA
Will you ever run away from me again?

LEPORELLO
No, my angel.

DONNA ELVIRA
Will you be mine for ever?

LEPORELLO
For ever.

DONNA ELVIRA
Beloved!

LEPORELLO
Beloved!
(aside)
The deception is proving pleasant.

DONNA ELVIRA
My treasure!

LEPORELLO
My Venus!

DONNA ELVIRA
I am all aflame for you.

LEPORELLO
I am burnt to ashes.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)

The rascal is warming up.
DONNA ELVIRA
And you won't betray me?

LEPORELLO
Certainly not.

DONNA ELVIRA
Swear it.

LEPORELLO
I swear it on this hand, which I kiss in ecstasy, and
those lovely eyes.

(Don Giovanni springs out of hiding and pretends
to be waylaying someone.)

DON GIOVANNI
Ha, ha, ha! Death to you!

DONNA ELVIRA, LEPORELLO
Ye gods!
(They run off.)

DON GIOVANNI
Ha, ha, ha! Fate seems to be on my side! Now
let's see. These are the windows. Let us serenade them.
(He picks up a mandolin left behind by Leporello
and begins to accompany himself.)

Canzonetta

Come to the window, my treasure,
come to console my lament.
If you deny me some relief,
I want to die before your eyes!
You whose mouth is sweeter than honey,
you whose heart cradles sweet desires!
Do not, my beloved, be cruel to me!
At least let me see you, my loved one!

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
There's someone at the window! Perhaps she!
Pst! Pst!
(Masetto enters followed by a group of peasants.)

MASETTO
Let us not become tired. My heart tells me we
must find him.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
Someone speaks!

MASETTO
Halt! I think someone moves over there.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
Unless I'm mistaken, it's Masetto!

MASETTO
Who goes there? No answer. Now then, shoulder
arms! Who goes there?

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
He's not alone. I must be careful.
(aloud)
Friends.
(aside)
I mustn't give myself away.
(aloud)
Is that you, Masetto?

MASETTO
Exactly right; and you?

DON GIOVANNI
Don't you know me? I'm the servant of Don Giovanni.

MASETTO
Leporello, the servant of that unworthy nobleman!

DON GIOVANNI
Certainly! Of that scoundrel!

MASETTO
Of that man without honour. Ah, tell me, where we
can find him? We are looking for him to kill him!

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
What nonsense!
(aloud)
Well said, Masetto! I will join you to put an end to
that rascal of a master. But listen a moment to my plan.

Aria

Some of you go this way,
the rest of you go that way!
And quietly, softly look for him,
he is not far from here!
If a man and a girl
you see strolling in the square,
if under some window
you hear someone making love,
fire away, by all means fire,
for it will be my master.
On his head he wears a hat
covered with white plumes,
over his shoulders a great cloak
and at his side a sword.

If a man, etc.
Some of you go this way, etc.
Hurry, go and find him,
but, you, come with me, Masetto.
We will do the rest,
and soon you will learn what that is, etc.
(The peasants go off.)

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI
Quiet! Let me listen! Good!
Now then, must we kill him?

MASETTO
Certainly.

DON GIOVANNI
Wouldn't it be sufficient to break his bones,
smash his shoulders?

MASETTO
No, no, I want to kill him,
I want to cut him into a hundred pieces.

DON GIOVANNI
Are your weapons good ones?

MASETTO
Indeed they are! I have this musket and then this
pistol, too.
(He hands the weapons to Don Giovanni for inspection.)

DON GIOVANNI
And then?

MASETTO
Isn't that enough?

DON GIOVANNI (beating Masetto)
Oh, certainly it's enough. Now this one is for the
pistol, this one for the musket!

MASETTO
Oh, oh, my head!

DON GIOVANNI
Keep quiet or I'll kill you! This one is for killing
him, this one for wanting to cut him into pieces!
Villain! Blackguard! Food for dogs!

(Don Giovanni leaves.)

MASETTO
Oh, oh, my head! Oh, my shoulders! Oh, my chest!

ZERLINA (entering with a lantern)
I thought I heard Masetto's voice!

MASETTO
Oh Lord, Zerlina, my Zerlina, help me!

ZERLINA
What happened?

MASETTO
The villain, the scoundrel broke my bones and
shattered my nerves.

ZERLINA
Oh, poor me! Who?

MASETTO
Leporello, or some devil who looks like him!

ZERLINA
Cruel man, didn't I warn you that this insane
jealousy of yours would bring some trouble? Where
does it hurt?

MASETTO
Here.

ZERLINA
And then?

MASETTO
Here, and also here!

ZERLINA
Nothing else hurts?

MASETTO
This foot hurts a little, this arm, and this hand.

ZERLINA
Come, come, no great harm is done if the rest of
you is sound. Come home with me, and if you
promise to be less jealous, I will take care of you,
my dear husband.

Aria

You'll see, my darling; if you are good,
what a fine cure I will give you!
It is a natural one, not unpleasant,
and the chemist can't make it.
It's a sure balm
which I have with me.
I can give it to you,
if you would like to try it.
Do you know where I keep it?
Feel it beating, touch me here! etc.
(They go out together.)

Scene Two

A dark courtyard of Donna Anna's house

Recitative

LEPORELLO
I see lights all around us, my love. Let us stay
hidden here until they go away.

DONNA ELVIRA
What are you afraid of, my adored husband?

LEPORELLO
Nothing, nothing. Merely precautions. I'll go and
see if the lights are moving away from us.
(aside)
Oh, how to free myself of her?
(aloud)
Stay here, beloved!

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, do not leave me!

Sextet

Alone, in this dark place
I feel my heart beating loudly,
and such a fear assails me
that I feel like dying.

LEPORELLO
The more I search for this door,
the harder it is to find it.
Softly, softly, I have found it!
Here's the moment to escape!
(Donna Anna and Don Ottavio enter.)

DON OTTAVIO
Dry your eyes, my own,
and ease your suffering!
By now the shade of your father
should have pity on your grief.

DONNA ANNA
Leave me this small outlet
to my grief.
Only death, my treasure,
can put an end to my tears.

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, where is my betrothed?

LEPORELLO
If she finds me, I am lost!

DONNA ELVIRA, LEPORELLO
I see a door there.
Softly. softly, I must leave!
(As Leporello is about to leave, Zerlina and
Masetto appear and confront him.)

ZERLINA, MASETTO
Halt, rascal! Where are you going?

DONNA ANNA, DON OTTAVIO
There is the wretch! How did he get there?

DONNA ANNA, ZERLINA, DON OTTAVIO, MASETTO
Ah, death to the ingrate
who has betrayed me!

DONNA ELVIRA
He is my husband! Have mercy!
Have mercy!

DONNA ANNA, ZERLINA, DON OTTAVIO, MASETTO
Is that Donna Elvira?
I can hardly believe it! No! He must die! etc.

(Don Ottavio draws his sword on Leporello who
removes his disguise and falls on his knees.)

LEPORELLO
Pardon, pardon me, good people!
I am not he; she is mistaken!
Let me live, I beg you!

DONNA ANNA, ZERLINA, DONNA ELVIRA,

DON OTTAVIO, MASETTO
Lord, Leporello!
What ruse is this?
I am dismayed!
What does it mean?

LEPORELLO
A thousand strange thoughts
are whirling in my head.
If I save myself from this storm,
it will truly be a miracle, etc.

DONNA ANNA, ZERLINA, DONNA ELVIRA,

DON OTTAVIO, MASETTO
A thousand strange thoughts
are whirling in my head.
What a day, my stars, this is!
What an unfortunate occurrence! etc.
(Donna Anna leaves.)

Recitative

ZERLINA
So it was you who, a short time ago, beat up my
Masetto!

DONNA ELVIRA
So it was you who tricked me, rascal, passing
yourself off as Don Giovanni!

DON OTTAVIO
So it was you who in this disguise came here to
commit some felony?

ZERLINA
It's up to me to punish him.

DONNA ELVIRA
No, to me.

DON OTTAVIO
No, no, to me.

MASETTO
Let us all have a hand in it.

Aria

LEPORELLO
Mercy, dear people!
Have mercy on me!
You are right to be angry,
but the fault is not mine.
My overbearing master
led me astray.
Donna Elvira, have pity!
You know what happened.
(to Zerlina)
Of Masetto I know nothing,
(indicating Donna Elvira)
this lady will confirm it.

For the past hour or thereabouts,
we have been together.
(to Don Ottavio)
To you, sir, I say nothing,
I was afraid, an unlucky chance,
a light approaching, darkness within.
No way out, the door, the wall,
then... well... I started that way
then hid over here, you know the rest.
But had I known I'd have fled this way!
(Leporello approaches the door and runs out.)

Recitative

DONNA ELVIRA
Halt, villain, halt!

MASETTO
The rascal has wings on his feet!

ZERLINA
With that trick he escaped us, the wretch.

DON OTTAVIO
My friends, after such doings we can no longer
doubt that Don Giovanni is the villainous murderer
of Donna Anna's father. Stay inside the house for
a while, and shortly I promise you vengeance. This
is the demand of pity, duty, and love!

Aria

Meanwhile, my treasure
go and console,
and from her lovely eyes
try to dry the tears.
Tell her that her wrongs
I am going to avenge,
that I shall not return
except with tidings of death.
Meanwhile, etc.
(All go off except Donna Elvira.)

Recitative & Aria

DONNA ELVIRA
Into what excesses, oh Lord, into what horrible
misdeeds the scoundrel has fallen! Ah, no, the
wrath and the justice of Heaven cannot delay any
longer. I already seem to see the fatal thunderbolt
striking his head! I see the grave opening at his
feet! Wretched Elvira! What contrasting emotions
rend me apart. Why these sighs? Why this anguish?
That ungrateful wretch betrayed me,
made me miserable, O Lord.
He betrayed and abandoned me,
but I still would forgive him.
That ungrateful wretch, etc.
When I feel my dreadful anguish,
my heart cries out for vengeance.
But if I gaze upon his features,
my heart still beats with excitement.
That ungrateful wretch, etc.

(She leaves.)

Scene Three

A graveyard. Night.

(This lonely spot is decorated with a number of
statues, including one of the Commendatore.)

Recitative

DON GIOVANNI (entering over a wall)
Ha, ha, ha. That's a good one. Now let her try to
find me! What a lovely night! It's clearer than
daytime, almost made for chasing the girls. Is it
late? Oh, not yet two o'clock. I would like to hear
how the affair ended between Leporello and Donna
Elvira. I wonder if he was prudent!

LEPORELLO (from behind the wall)
He wants to be the ruin of me.

DON GIOVANNI
It is he; oh, Leporello!

LEPORELLO
Who wants me?

DON GIOVANNI
Don't you know your master?

LEPORELLO
If only I didn't!

DON GIOVANNI
What, you wretch!

LEPORELLO (entering)
Ah, it's you? Pardon me.

DON GIOVANNI
What happened?

LEPORELLO
Because of you I was nearly killed.

DON GIOVANNI
Well, would you not have been honoured?

LEPORELLO
It's an honour I can do without.

DON GIOVANNI
Come, come! Now listen! What wonderful things I
have to tell you.

LEPORELLO
But what are you doing here?
(Leporello enters; they change clothes.)

DON GIOVANNI
Come over here and I'll tell you. A number of
amusing incidents have befallen me since we
separated, but I will relate them another time. Just
now there is only one I will tell you.

LEPORELLO
Feminine, for certain.

DON GIOVANNI
Can you doubt it? A damsel pretty, young,
flirtatious, I met in the street; I drew near to her,
took her hand. She tried to escape. I spoke a few
words, and she mistook me for, but guess who?

LEPORELLO
I have no idea.

DON GIOVANNI
For Leporello.

LEPORELLO
For me?

DON GIOVANNI
For you.

LEPORELLO
How nice.

DON GIOVANNI
So then she took my hand.

LEPORELLO
Better still.

DON GIOVANNI
She caressed me, embraced me: "My dear
Leporello! Leporello, my dear!" So I realised she
was one of your conquests.

LEPORELLO
Damn you!

DON GIOVANNI
Naturally I took advantage of her mistake. I don't
know how she recognised me, but suddenly she
began to scream. I heard people coming and I ran
away. Then quickly I climbed over that wall.

LEPORELLO
And you tell me this with such indifference?

DON GIOVANNI
Why not?

LEPORELLO
But what if this girl had been my wife?

DON GIOVANNI
Better still!

THE STATUE OF THE COMMENDATORE
You will have your last laugh before the next dawn!

DON GIOVANNI
Who spoke?

LEPORELLO
Ah, it must be some spirit from another world who
knows you well.

DON GIOVANNI
Keep quiet, you fool. Who goes there?
(He puts his hand on his sword.)

THE STATUE
Audacious libertine! Leave the dead in peace!

LEPORELLO
I told you so!

DON GIOVANNI
It must be someone outside having a joke on us!
Hey, isn't this the Commendatore's statue? Read
the inscription.

LEPORELLO
Excuse me, but I never learned to read by
moonlight.

DON GIOVANNI
Read, I tell you!

LEPORELLO
"Upon the base one who sent me to my death I
here await vengeance." Did you hear that? I'm afraid!

DON GIOVANNI
You old buffoon! Tell him that tonight I expect him
to dinner!

LEPORELLO
What madness! But do you think - oh Lord, look at
the terrible glances he throws us! He seems alive!
As if he heard us and wants to speak!

DON GIOVANNI
Go on, go over there! Or I'll kill you on the spot
and bury you right here!

LEPORELLO
Softly, softly, sir. Now I obey.

Duet

Oh, most noble statue
of the great Commendatore...
Master, I'm afraid.
I cannot go through with it!

DON GIOVANNI
Finish it, or in your breast
I'll sink this blade!

LEPORELLO (aside)
What a mess! What an idea!

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
What fun! What a joke!

LEPORELLO
I'm frozen with fright!

DON GIOVANNI
I want to make him tremble!

LEPORELLO
O most noble statue,
although you're made of marble...
Ah, master, look!
He's gazing at me still!

DON GIOVANNI
Die then!

LEPORELLO
No, wait!
Sir, my master,
I said my master, not I,
would like to dine with you!
Ah, what a scene this is!
Oh Heaven, he nodded his head!

DON GIOVANNI
Go on! You're a buffoon!

LEPORELLO
Look again, master!

DON GIOVANNI
What should I look at?

LEPORELLO, then with DON GIOVANNI
With his marble head,
he nods like this, like this!

DON GIOVANNI (to the statue)
Speak, if you can.
You'll come to dinner?

THE STATUE
Yes!

LEPORELLO
I can barely move,
my strength, oh Lord, has fled!
For pity's sake, let's go,
let's fly away from here!

DON GIOVANNI
The scene is truly strange,
the old man will come to dinner.
Let us go and prepare it,
let us leave this place.
(They leave.)

Scene Four

A room in Donna Anna's house

Recitative

DON OTTAVIO
Calm yourself, my beloved. We will see the base
one punished for his grave crimes; and we will be avenged.

DONNA ANNA
But my father, Lord!

DON OTTAVIO
We must bow our heads to Heaven's will.
Compose yourself, my dear! If you wish, I will
compensate tomorrow for your bitter loss, with my
heart, my hand, my tender love.

DONNA ANNA
Ye gods! What are you saying at such a sad time?

DON OTTAVIO
What now? Would you with new sorrows increase
my own grief? Cruel one!

Recitative & Aria

DONNA ANNA
Cruel? Ah no, my love, I am too unhappy at having
to put off the joy which we have both desired for
so long. But what would people say! Do not try to
shake the resolution of my poor heart. Your love
speaks for you!
Do not tell me, my true love,
that I am cruel to you.
You know well how much I love you,
you know to whom I am pledged.
Calm your anguish,
if you do not wish me to die of grief.
Do not tell me, etc.
Perhaps some day Heaven
will have pity on me.
(She leaves.)

Recitative

DON OTTAVIO
Ah, I shall follow her, and share her sorrows; with
me at her side her sighs will be less painful.
(He leaves.)

Scene Five

A room in Don Giovanni's house

(The table has been set for dinner. Don Giovanni's
musicians are awaiting the order to play.)

Finale

DON GIOVANNI
The dinner is prepared.
Play, my dear friends!
Since I spend my money freely,
I want to be amused.
Leporello, serve me, quickly.

LEPORELLO
I am ready to serve you.

DON GIOVANNI
Since I spend my money freely,
I want to be amused, etc,
Play, my dear friends, etc.
(The orchestra begins to play an aria from Martin s
"Una cosa rara".)

LEPORELLO
Excellent! "Cosa rara!"

DON GIOVANNI
What do you think of this fine concert?

LEPORELLO
It is worthy of you.

DON GIOVANNI
Ah, what a delicious dish!

LEPORELLO (aside)
Ah what a barbarous appetite!
What gigantic mouthfuls!
I think I'm going to faint! etc.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
As he sees my huge mouthfuls,
he thinks he's going to faint, etc.

LEPORELLO
Ah, what a barbarous appetite, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
As he sees my huge mouthfuls, etc.
Service!

LEPORELLO
At once!
(The orchestra begins to play a piece from Sarti's
"Fra i due litiganti".)
Hurray for "The litiganti".

DON GIOVANNI
Pour the wine!
Excellent marzimino!

LEPORELLO (aside)
This piece of pheasant
I myself will swallow.

DON GIOVANNI (aside)
The rogue is eating!
I'll pretend I do not notice.
(The orchestra begins to play from Mozart's
"Le nozze di Figaro".)

LEPORELLO
I know this piece only too well.

DON GIOVANNI
Leporello!

LEPORELLO (his mouth full)
Master!

DON GIOVANNI
Speak clearly, you rascal!

LEPORELLO
A cold prevents me
from speaking better.

DON GIOVANNI
While I eat whistle something.

LEPORELLO
I don't know how.

DON GIOVANNI
Why not?

LEPORELLO
Excuse me, but your cook is so excellent
that I too wanted to taste it.

DON GIOVANNI
So excellent is my cook,
that he too wanted to taste it.

DON GIOVANNI, LEPORELLO
So excellent, etc.

DONNA ELVIRA (entering excitedly)
The last test of your love
I want to make now.
I no longer remember your lies.
Pity I feel.

DON GIOVANNI, LEPORELLO
What is it?

DONNA ELVIRA (kneeling)
My sor rowful hear t
does not beg for boons.

DON GIOVANNI
I am amazed! What do you ask?
If you don't arise, I won't remain standing.

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, do not laugh at my despair!

LEPORELLO
She almost makes me weep, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
I laugh at you? Heavens! What for?
What do you want, my dear?

DONNA ELVIRA
That you change your ways!

DON GIOVANNI
Good for you!

DONNA ELVIRA
Faithless heart!

DON GIOVANNI
Good for you!

DONNA ELVIRA
Faithless heart!

DONNA ELVIRA, LEPORELLO
Faithless heart!

DON GIOVANNI
Now let me eat,
and if you wish to, eat with me.

DONNA ELVIRA
Stay here then, ingrate!
Wallow in your crimes,
a horrible example of iniquity! etc.

LEPORELLO
If her grief fails to move him,
his heart is of stone, or he has none at all, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
Hurray for women,
hurray for wine!
The substance and glory of humanity! etc.

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah!
(Donna Elvira starts out of one door, screams,
recoils and rushes through another door.)

DON GIOVANNI, LEPORELLO
Why did she scream?

DON GIOVANNI
Go and see what it was.
(Leporello goes out and before re-entering also screams.)

LEPORELLO
Ah!

DON GIOVANNI
What a scream!
Leporello, what is it?

LEPORELLO
Oh, sir, for pity's sake
don't leave the room!
The man of stone, the man in white,
ah, master, I'm afraid, I'm going to faint.
If you could see what he looks like,
if you could hear how he moves!
Ta ta ta ta!

DON GIOVANNI
I understand none of this.

LEPORELLO
Ta ta ta ta!

DON GIOVANNI
You've gone out of your mind.
(There is a loud knocking at the door.)

LEPORELLO
Ah, listen!

DON GIOVANNI
Someone knocks.
Open the door!

LEPORELLO
I'm afraid!

DON GIOVANNI
Open it, I say!

LEPORELLO
Ah!

DON GIOVANNI
Open!

LEPORELLO
Ah!

DON GIOVANNI
Lunatic! To put an end to it
I shall have to go myself.

LEPORELLO
I have no wish to see that again,
so quietly I'll hide.
(The statue enters. Leporello hides under the table.)

THE STATUE
Don Giovanni, you invited me to dinner
and I have come!

DON GIOVANNI
I never would have believed it,
but I will do what I can.
Leporello, see to it
that another dinner is served at once!

LEPORELLO
Ah, master, we are lost.

DON GIOVANNI
Go, I said!

THE STATUE
Wait a moment! He who dines on Heavenly food
has no need for the food of the mortals!
Other more serious considerations
have caused me to come here!

LEPORELLO
I feel as if I have a fever,
for I cannot control my limbs.

DON GIOVANNI
Speak then! What do you ask? What do you wish?

THE STATUE
I will speak. Listen! My time is short! etc.

DON GIOVANNI
Speak then, for I am listening, etc.

LEPORELLO
For I cannot control my limbs, etc.

THE STATUE
You invited me to dinner,
now you know your duty.
Answer me: will you come to dine with me?

LEPORELLO
Oh my! Excuse him, but he doesn't have time.

DON GIOVANNI
No one will say of me
that I have ever been afraid.

THE STATUE
Make up your mind!

DON GIOVANNI
I have done so already!

THE STATUE
You will come?

LEPORELLO
Tell him no!

DON GIOVANNI
My heart beats firmly.
I'm not afraid: I'll come!

THE STATUE
Give me your hand upon it!

DON GIOVANNI
Here it is!
(He gives the statue his hand.)
Oh me!

THE STATUE
What is wrong?

DON GIOVANNI
What is this deadly chill?

THE STATUE
Repent! Change your ways,
for this is your last hour!

DON GIOVANNI (trying to free himself)
No, no, I will not repent.
Let me be!

THE STATUE
Repent, scoundrel!

DON GIOVANNI
No, you old fool!

THE STATUE
Repent! etc.

DON GIOVANNI
No! etc.

THE STATUE
Yes!

DON GIOVANNI
No!

THE STATUE
Yes!

DON GIOVANNI
No!

LEPORELLO
Yes! Yes!

DON GIOVANNI
No! No!

THE STATUE
Ah, your time is up!
(The statue disappears. Flames appear on all
sides and the earth begins to tremble under Don
Giovanni's feet.)

DON GIOVANNI
What strange fear
now assails my soul!
Where do those
flames of horror come from?

CHORUS OF DEMONS
No horror is too dreadful for you!
Come, there is worse in store!

DON GIOVANNI
Who lacerates my soul?
Who torments my body?
What torment, oh me, what agony!
What a Hell! What a terror!

LEPORELLO
What a look of desperation!
The gestures of the damned!
What cries, what laments!
How he makes me afraid!

CHORUS
No horror is too dreadful, etc.

DON GIOVANNI
Who lacerates, etc.

LEPORELLO
What a look, etc.

DON GIOVANNI, then LEPORELLO
Ah!
(The flames engulf Don Giovanni. After his
disappearance everything returns to normal and
the other characters enter.)

Epilogue

DONNA ELVIRA, DONNA ANNA, ZERLINA,

DON OTTAVIO, MASETTO
Where is the villain?
Where is the ingrate?
All my rage
I want to vent on him!

DONNA ANNA
Only when I see him
bound in chains
will my anguish
be soothed.

LEPORELLO
Abandon hope
of ever finding him.
Give up your search,
he has gone far away.

THE OTHERS
What has happened? Tell us!
Come now, hurr y up!

LEPORELLO
A giant came,
but I can't go on -

THE OTHERS
Quickly, tell us, hurry up!

LEPORELLO
In flames and smoke,
listen to this,
the man of stone -
wait a moment -
just over there
gave the sign,
and just over there the Devil
came and dragged him down!

THE OTHERS
My stars, what did I hear!

LEPORELLO
I've told you the truth!

DONNA ELVIRA
Ah, it must have been the ghost
I met out there.

DONNA ANNA, ZERLINA, DON OTTAVIO, MASETTO
Ah, it must have been the ghost
she met out there, etc.

DON OTTAVIO
Now, my treasure, that we
have been avenged by Heaven,
grant me my reward,
do not let me pine any more.

DONNA ANNA
My dearest, let me mourn
for one year more.

DON OTTAVIO
A lover must yield to the desires
of one who adores him, etc.

DONNA ANNA
A lover must yield to the desires
of one who adores him, etc.

DONNA ELVIRA
I shall retire to a convent
to end my life there!

ZERLINA
We, Masetto, will go home
to dine together!

MASETTO
We, Zerlina, will go home
to dine together!

LEPORELLO
And I'll go to the tavern
and find myself a better master.

ZERLINA, MASETTO, LEPORELLO
So the wretch can stay
down there with Proserpine and Pluto.
And we, good people, will now
gaily sing to you
the old, old refrain.

ALL
This is the end which befalls evildoers.
And in this life scoundrels
always receive their just deserts! etc.

END
