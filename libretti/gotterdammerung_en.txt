Prelude

(The curtain rises slowly. The scene is the same as
at the close of the second day [Die Walküre], on the
Valkyries' rock: Night. Firelight shines up from the
valley at the back.)
(The three Norns, tall women in dark, veil-like
drapery. The first [oldest] lies in the foreground on the
right, under the spreading fir tree; the second
[younger] is stretched on a rock in front of the cave;
the third [youngest] sits in the center at back on a
rock below the peak. Gloomy silence and stillness.)

First Norn
What light shineth there?

Second Norn
Dawneth the day so soon?

Third Norn
Loge's host glows in flame around the fell.
Still 'tis night.
Why spin we and sing we not now?

2nd Norn
(to the first)
While we are spinning and singing,
whereon stretch we the rope?
(The first Norn unwinds a golden rope from herself
and ties one end of it to a branch of the pine tree.)

1st Norn
Be good or ill the song,
winding the rope thus sing I.
At the world-ash-tree once I wove
when far and wide from the stem outbranched
a wondrous verdant wood.
In its cooling shadow rose a spring:
whisp'ring wisdom rippled its waves;
of holy things I sang.
A dauntless god came to drink at the well;
as eternal tribute paid was the light of an eye.
From the world-ash-tree Wotan's hand a branch did break;
from the bough he shaped the mighty shaft of his spear.
The wound, as time grew old,
wasted the life of the wood;
sere, leafless and stricken, fast faded the tree;
sadly then failed the fountain's flow:
darksome meaning filled all my song.
Today I weave at the world-ash-tree no more,
now must the pine tree serve me to fasten the rope.
Sing, o sister; wind thou the rope:
know' st thou what will hap?
(The second Norn winds the rope thrown to her
around a projecting rack at the entrance of the cave.)

2nd Norn
Runes of treaties deeply pondered
graved Wotan in the shaft of the spear:
he holds it to sway the world.
A hero bold in fight has broken the spear;
in splinters shivered the treaties' hallowed haft.
Then bade Wotan Walhall's heroes
to hew down the world-ash's stem
and the withered boughs to cut in pieces:
the ash tree sank;
spent then for aye was the spring.
Now round the sharp-edged rock I bind the rope.
Sing, o sister; wind the rope:
know'st thou, what will hap?

3rd Norn
(catching the rope and throwing the end
behind her)
The castle stands by giants upraised:
with the gods and the hallowed host of the heroes
sitteth Wotan on high.
The lofty pile of riven boughs
like a wall standeth round Walhall:
the world-ash-tree was this once!
When its wood burnetii, glowing and bright,
then shall flames feed on the glittering halls:
the end of all godhood dawneth
then forever and aye.
Know ye yet more?
Then wind ye the rope once again;
from northward now I cast it to thee.
(She throws the rope to the second Norn. The
second Norn throws it to the first, who loosens the
rope from the bough and fastens it on another.)
Spin, o sister, and sing thou!

1st Norn
(looking toward the back)
Dawneth the day? Is it fire that flickers?
My sight sorrow has dimmed;
the holy vision of old time fadeth,
when Loge long since blazed forth in glowing flame.
Know' st thou what happed to him?

2nd Norn
(winding the rope thrown to her again
around the rock)
By the spear's enchantment
Wotan enthralled him;
help he gave to the god.
From his galling fetters freedom to win,
he gnawed the runes of the shaft:
then with the mighty spell of the spear-point
Wotan confined him,
flaming round Brünnhilde's fastness.
Know'st thou what will befall?

3rd Norn
(catching the rope again and throwing it
behind her)
With the shattered spear-shaft's piercing splinters
Wotan woundeth the burning one deep in the
breast:
ravaging flames flare from the wound
and seize the shaft, which the god casts
'mid the heaped up boughs of the ash tree.
(She throws the rope back; the second Norn winds
it up and throws it back again to the first.)

2nd Norn
What befalleth, would ye know?
Wind then, sisters, the rope!

1st Norn
(fastening the rope again)
The night wanes; dark are my senses:
I feel no more the strands of the rope;
unwound and loose are its threads.
A hideous sight wounds and vexes mine eyes:
the Rhine-gold robbed by Alberich once:
know'st thou what came thereof?

(The second Norn with busy haste winds the rope
around the jagged rock at the cave's mouth.)

2nd Norn
The rope is parting, cut by the crag,
no more fast is its hold on the rock;
it hangs raveled and frayed:
through wrath and wrong
rises the Nibelung's ring:
a curse of revenge
gnaws at the moldering strands.
Know'st thou what comes thereof?

3rd Norn
(hastily catching the rope thrown to her)
Too slack is the rope, it reaches not.
If to the north its end shall be cast,
yet straighter must it be stretched!
(She pulls hard at the rope, which breaks.)
It breaks!

2nd Norn
It breaks!

1st Norn
It breaks!
(They take hold of the pieces of the broken rope
and bind their bodies together with them.)

The Three Norns
No more speaketh our wisdom!
The world now shall hear us no more.

3rd Norn
Descend!

2nd Norn
To Erda!

1st Norn
Descend!
(They vanish.)
(Dawn. The red glow of sunrise grows; the light of
the fire from below gradually fades.)
(Sunrise.)
(Broad daylight. Siegfried and Brünnhilde enter
from the cave; he is fully armed; she leads her horse
by the bridle.)

Brünnhilde
Beloved hero, forth must I send thee,
love helpeth not holding thee here!
One only doubt yet makes me linger,
that all thy winning hath little worth.
What gold have shewn me gave I thee:
holiest runes in richest hoard;
but all my maidhood's hallowed strength
stole he from me, who is now my hero.
In wisdom weak, but strong in will:
in love so rich, so poor in power,
her scanty worth thou wilt disdain not,
who all has granted and nought more can give.

Siegfried
Wonder of women,
more gav'st thou than I can ward.
O chide not, if thy lessons have left me still
untaught.

One rede yet I well have read:
(with fire) that for me Brünnhild' lives;
one lesson well I learned:
Brünnhilde to remember!

Brünnhilde
Wilt thou with love ever bless me;
remember only thyself:
thy dauntless deeds remember:
remember the flaming fire
that fearless thou defiedst,
when around the rock it burned!

Siegfried
Brünnhilde so to win me.

Brünnhilde
Forget not the shield-hidden maid
whom in slumber deep thou foundest,
and whose fastened helm thou didst break.

Siegfried
Brünnhilde to awaken.

Brünnhilde
Those oaths remember
that have bound us;
the troth remember that we plighted;
the love we live for aye remember:
Brünnhilde then will burn forever
deep in thy breast.
(She embraces Siegfried.)

Siegfried
Love, I leave thee alone
in thy fastness guarded by fire;
(He has drawn Alberich's ring from his finger and
now holds it out to Brünnhilde.)
for all thy runes I give thee
now as guerdon this ring.
Of the deeds my hand performed
the virtue there doth lie.
With my sword a dragon I slew,
who long had watched it in hate.
Now guard thou surely the gold
as witness true of my love!

Brünnhilde
(putting on the ring in rapture)
Ne'er shall it be reft from my hand!
For the ring take thou now my horse!
Though he once did fly
with me through the heavens,
with me he lost all his magic power;
over clouds afar, mid lightning and thunder,
no more boldly aloft will he fly;
yet where'er thou shalt lead,
e'en through the fire,
fearlessly Grane will follow:
for henceforth, hero, shall he obey thee.
Oh, ward him well; he knows thy voice:
Oh, speak to Grane oft Brünnhilde's name!

Siegfried
Then through thy virtue alone
will shine my deeds of valor!
All my battles thou wilt choose,
all my triumphs thou wilt achieve!
If with thy shield I ward me,
if on thy steed I fight,
then Siegfried am I no more,
I am but Brünnhilde's arm.

Brünnhilde
O were but Brünnhilde thy spirit!

Siegfried
Through her my valor doth burn.

Brünnhilde
Then thou wert Siegfried and Brünnhild'!

Siegfried
Where I am both are together.

Brünnhilde
(with animation)
Then my rock home deserted lies?

Siegfried
Made one, both there abide!

Brünnhilde
(in highest excitement)
O heavenly rulers! Race of eternals!
Turn now your eyes on this hallowed pair!
Apart, who shall divide us?
Divided, ne'er will we part!

Siegfried
Hail, o Brünnhilde, radiant star!

Brünnhilde
Hail, o Siegfried, conquering light!

Siegfried
Hail, rapture of loving!
Hail, gladdening star!
Hail, Brünnhild'!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

Brünnhilde
Hail, rapture of living!
Hail, conquering light!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
(Siegfried leads the horse quickly toward the edge
of the slope; Brünnhilde follows him.)
(Siegfried has disappeared with the horse down
behind the projecting rock so that he is no longer visi-
ble to the audience; Brünnhilde stands thus suddenly
alone at the edge of the slope and follows Siegfried
with her eyes as he descends.)
(Brünnhilde's demeanor shows that Siegfried now
vanishes from her sight. Siegfried's horn is heard from
below. Brünnhilde listens.)
(She steps further out on the slope. Now she again
catches sight of Siegfried in the valley: she greets him
with a gesture of delight. Her joyful smiles seem a
reflection of the gay demeanor of the departing
hero.)
(Here the curtain must be quickly lowered.)
(During the last four bars the curtain is raised
again.)

Act One

Scene One

(The hall of the Gibichungs on the Rhine. This is
quite open at the back. The background itself pre-
sents an open shore as far as the river; rocky heights
enclose the shore.)
(Gunther and Gutrune on a throne on one side,
before which stands a table with drinking vessels on
it; Hagen is seated in front of the table.)

Gunther
Give ear, Hagen; tell me now true:
is my fame on the Rhine
worthy of Gibich's name?

Hagen
Thy glory's luster wakens my envy;
for she who gave us life,
Dame Grimhild, told of thy greatness.

Gunther
I envy thee; then envy not me.
Mine thought he firstborn's right,
wisdom was thine alone.
Half-brothers' strife was ne'er so well ended;
'tis thy wisdom wins my praise
when I ask of my renown.

Hagen
Then blame I my word,
since flawed is thy fame
for treasures rare I wot of
that the Gibichungs not yet have won.

Gunther
If these thou hide, I blame thee too.

Hagen
In ripeness and strength of summer
standeth Gibich's race,
thou, Gunther, yet unwived,
thou, Gutrun', yet unwed.
(Gunther and Gutrune are lost in silent medi-
tation.)

Gunther
Whom wouldst thou I should wed
that we new fame may win?

Hagen
A wife waits thee, the noblest in the world:
'mid mountain rocks her home,
a fire surroundeth her hall:
who breaks thro' the flaming fire
may Brünnhilde's wooer be.

Gunther
And serves not my strength for the task?

Hagen
For a stronger one it is decreed.

Gunther
Who is that boldest of men?

Hagen
Siegfried, the Wälsung son,
he is the chosen man.
A twin-born pair, in love's enthrallment,
Siegmund and Sieglind' begat them the hero renowned.

Strong and bold he grew in the woods;
him would I Gutrun' should wed.

Gutrune
(beginning shyly)
What deed brought him such fame
that of heroes the first he is named?

Hagen
At Neidhöhle the Niblung's hoard
long since by a dragon was held:
Siegfried closed his threatening jaws
and slew with conquering sword.
That great and wondrous deed
first won him a hero's fame.

Gunther
(in meditation)
The hoard of the Niblungs holdeth,
men say, a jewel of worth.

Hagen
The man who its might doth know
would bend all the world to his will.

Gunther
And Siegfried won it in fight?

Hagen
Thrall are the Niblungs to him.

Gunther
And Brünnhild' he only can win?

Hagen
To none other waneth the fire.
(Gunther rises angrily from his seat.)

Gunther
Why wak'st thou discord and doubt?
Why stir my heart's desire
by dreams of delights I may not win?
(He walks to and fro in agitation. Hagen, without
leaving his seat, by a gesture full of hidden meaning
holds Gunther fixed as he approaches him.)

Hagen
Yet should Siegfried bring home the bride,
then were not Brünnhilde thine?
(Gunther turns away again in doubt and anger.)
Gunther
Yet how could I force this man
for me to win the bride?

Hagen
(as before)
Thy prayer alone would force him
were but Gutrun' his wife.

Gutrune
Thou mocker, evil Hagen!
What spell have I to bind him?
If he of heroes be first on earth,
the fairest women in the world
long since would have won his love.

Hagen
(bending confidentially to Gutrune)
Dost mind the drink in the chest;
(more secretly)
put trust in me who brought it home;

'Twill bind him whom thou dost choose
fast in love's fetters to thee.
(Gunther has again come to the table and,
leaning upon it, listens attentively.)
Let now but Siegfried come
and taste of the magical draught,
that he e'er a woman has seen,
that one anear him e'er came,
then straightway must he forget.
Now answer: how like ye Hagen's rede?

Gunther
(starting up with animation)
All praise be to Grimhild,
that now this brother is ours!

Gutrune
Might but Siegfried hither come!

Gunther
What spell may find him out?
(A horn on the stage, from the background on the
left, very loud but distant. Hagen listens. He turns to
Gunther.)

Hagen
Merrily hunts he, seeking renown,
as through a wood he sweeps the world:
while restless he storms on his way,
to the Gibich's home will he come.

Gunther
Welcome to him would I give.
(Horn on the stage, nearer, but still distant.
Gunther and Hagen listen.)
A horn from the Rhine I hear.
(Hagen looks down the river, and calls toward the back.)

Hagen
On board a vessel man and horse!
He blows so gaily the horn!
(Horn on the stage, nearer. Gunther stops halfway,
listening.)
With an easy stroke,
as from indolent hand,
he drives the boat fast thro' the waves:
so mighty an arm only one can own;
his it must be who the dragon slew.
Siegfried is it, surely none other!

Gunther
Come he to us?
(Hagen calls toward the river through his
hollowed hands.)

Hagen
Hoiho! Whom seek'st thou, hero blithe?

Siegfried
(from the distance)
The stalwart son of Gibich.

Hagen
His hall awaits thee with welcome here.
(Siegfried appears at the shore in a boat.)
Hither! Here come to land!

Scene Two

(Siegfried brings his boat to the shore.)

Hagen
Hail!
(Hagen makes the boat fast to the shore with the
chain. Siegfried springs on shore with his horse.)
Hail! Siegfried, hero, hail!
(Gunther has come to Hagen on the riverbank.
Gutrune looks from the throne in astonishment at
Sieg fried. Gunther prepares to offer friendly greet ings.
All are fixed in mute contemplation of each other.)

Siegfried
(leaning on his horse, remains standing by
the boat)
Who is Gibich's son?

Gunther
Gunther, I, whom thou seek'st.

Siegfried
Far on the Rhine thy fame hath spread:
now fight with me, or be my friend!

Gunther
Come in peace! Be thou welcome!

Siegfried
Where resteth my horse?

Hagen
Mine be his charge.

Siegfried
(turning to Hagen)
Thou call'st me Siegfried: met we ere now?

Hagen
I knew by thy might who thou must be.

Siegfried
(as he gives the horse to Hagen)
Tend Grane right gently:
of nobler strain thy hand never held
by bridle a steed.
(Hagen leads the horse away. While Siegfried
looks thoughtfully after him, Gutrune, guided by a
gesture of Hagen's which is unseen by Siegfried, goes
out through a door on the left leading to her room.
Gunther comes to the front with Siegfried, whom he
invites to accom pany him.)

Gunther
O hero, gladly greet
the halls where dwelt my fathers.
Where'er thou standest, whate'er thou seest,
my goods I freely grant thee;
thine is my birthright, folk and land:
pledge of troth be my lifeblood!
Henceforth am I thine own.

Siegfried
Nor land nor folk have I to grant
nor father's house and hall:
all my birthright my bod/ s life
living wasteth away.
Yet a sword blade have I forged me:
pledge of troth be my weapon!
That with my life give I thee.

Hagen
(who has returned and now stands behind
Siegfried)
Of the hoard of the Niblungs
rumor nameth thee lord.

Siegfried
(turning around to Hagen)
The treasure had I forgot;
so lightly its wealth I prize!
I in a cavern left it lying,
where a dragon once held watch.

Hagen
And nought didst take therefrom?

Siegfried
(pointing to the piece of steel netting
which hangs from his girdle)
Nought but this, not knowing its use!

Hagen
The Tarnhelm it is,
the Niblung's cunningest work:
it serves, when set on thy head,
to transform thee e'en as thou wilt;
wouldst fain go to far-off lands,
thy desire straight were fulfilled.
Nought else took'st thou from the hoard?

Siegfried
A ring.

Hagen
That holdest thou safe?

Siegfried
(tenderly) 'Tis held by a woman fair.

Hagen
(aside) Brünnhild'!

Gunther
Nought, Siegfried, now shalt thou give me;
dross would pay thee in return,
though all my wealth thou shouldst win:
without guerdon thee will I serve.
(Hagen has gone to Gutrune's door and now
opens it. Gutrune enters and approaches Siegfried,
carrying a filled drinking horn.)

Gutrune
Welcome, o guest, to Gibich's house!
From his daughter take thou this drink.
(Siegfried bows friendly to her and takes the horn.
He holds the horn meditatively before him.)

Siegfried
If lost were all thou gavest to me,
one lesson still I ne'er will forget;
this draught, the first my lips have tasted,
Brünnhild', I drink to thee!
(He puts the drink-horn to his lips and drinks a
long draught. He returns the drink-horn to Gutrune
who casts down her eyes before him in shame and
confusion. Siegfried fixes his eyes on her with sudden-
ly inflamed passion.)
O thou who dost blind my sight by thy look,
why sink'st thou before me thine eyes?
(Gutrune, blushing, raises her eyes to his face.)

(vehemently) Ha, fairest maid! Veil thy look;
the heart in my breast burns in its beams,
to fiery scorching streams
I feel it kindle my blood!
(with trembling voice)
Gunther, what name is thy sister's?

Gunther
Gutrune.

Siegfried
(softly) Are good the runes that there in
her eyes I am reading?
(He seizes Gutrune's hand ardently.)
With thy brother service I have sought:
his pride refused my bond;
wilt thou like him deny my prayer,
if for thy grace I crave!
(Gutrune involuntarily meets Hagen's look. She
humbly bows her head and, with a gesture express-
ing her feeling of unworthiness, she leaves the hall
with faltering steps.)
(Siegfried, observantly watched by Hagen and
Gunther, follows Gutrune with his eyes as if
entranced.)
Hast thou, Gunther, a wife?

Gunther
Not wed am I yet,
and for a wife seemeth it vain to seek:
on one my heart have I set,
whom no deed of mine can win.

Siegfried
(turns with animation to Gunther)
What canst thou not win, with me for friend?

Gunther
On mountain rocks her home;...

Siegfried
(breaking in hastily in astonishment)
On mountain rocks her home?

Gunther
... a fire surrounds her hall.

Siegfried
A fire surrounds her hall?

Gunther
Who breaks through the flaming fire .

Siegfried
(as if striving with intense effort to
remember something)
Who breaks thro' the flaming fire?

Gunther
... may Brünnhilde's wooer be.
(Siegfried shows by a gesture that at the mention
of Brünnhilde's name his remembrance has quite
faded.)
I may not set foot on the mountain;
the fire wanes not for me!
(Siegfried comes to himself from his dreamy state
and turns to Gunther with excessive gaiety.)

Siegfried
I fear no fire,
for thee I will win the bride;
for thy man am I,
and my arm is thine,
if Gutrun' thou giv'st me to wife.

Gunther
Gutrune gladly I grant thee.

Siegfried
Brünnhilde then shall be thine.

Gunther
How wilt thou beguile her?

Siegfried
By the Tarnhelm's craft
changed shall my shape be for thine.

Gunther
Then let the oath now be sworn!

Siegfried
Blood-brotherhood bound be by oath!
(Hagen fills a drinking horn with wine; he holds it
out to Siegfried and Gunther, who cut their arms with
their swords and hold them for a few moments over
the top of the horn. Both lay two fingers on the horn,
which Hagen continues to hold between them.)
Blossoming life's renewing blood
into the draught I shed.

Gunther
Boldly mixed in brotherly love
bloom our blood in the draught

Both
Troth I drink to the friend!
Blithe and free let flow from our bond,
blood-brotherhood aye!

Gunther
Broke if e'er be the bond:...

Siegfried
False if friend be to friend,...

Both
What in drops of love here we have drunken
in streams shall freely flow:
traitor thus shall atone!
(Gunther drinks and gives the horn to Siegfried.)

Gunther
So swear I the oath!

Siegfried
So...
(He drinks and holds the empty drinking horn out to Hagen.)
...plight I my faith.
(Hagen strikes the horn into two pieces with his
sword. Gunther and Siegfried join hands.)
(Siegfried observes Hagen, who has stood behind
him during the oath.)
Thou took'st in our troth-plight no part?

Hagen
My blood were bane to your drink;
not pure and free like yours doth it flow:
stubborn and cold scarce it stirs,
my cheek it never doth redden:
so far I keep from fiery bonds.

Gunther
(to Siegfried) Give no heed to his spleen!
(Siegfried puts on his shield again.)

Siegfried
Forth let us fare!
There lies my boat:
swiftly sail to the mountain!
(He steps nearer to Gunther and points.)
By the shore but one night
on board shalt thou tarry;
the bride then shall be thine.
(He turns to go, and beckons Gunther to follow
him.)

Gunther
Takest thou first no rest?

Siegfried
Let my labor win my rest.
(He goes to the shore to cast the boat loose.)

Gunther
Thou, Hagen! be guard of the homestead!
(He follows Siegfried to the shore. After Siegfried
and Gunther have laid their arms in the boat, while
they put up the sail and make all ready for departure,
Hagen takes up his spear and shield.)
(Gutrune appears at the door of her apartment
just as Siegfried pushes off the boat, which immedi-
ately floats into the middle of the stream.)

Gutrune
So fast! say, whither fly they?

Hagen
(while he slowly takes his seat in front of the
hall with shield and spear)
They fly Brünnhild' to wed.

Gutrune
Siegfried?

Hagen
See how he hastes!
For wife so would he win thee!

Gutrune
Siegfried mine!
(She returns to her apartment in lively agitation.)
(Siegfried has seized an oar and with its strokes
drives the boat down the stream so that it is quickly
lost to view.)
(Hagen sits motionless, leaning his back against
the post of the hall entrance.)

Hagen
Here sit I on guard, watching the house,
warding the hall from the foe.
Winds are wafting Gibich's son,
afar to his wooing he fares.
His helm is held by a hero bold,
for Gunther peril he braves:
His rightful bride he brings to the Rhine;
with her he brings me the ring!
Ye sons of freedom, blithesome companions
sail ye now merrily on:
base though ye deem him, ye all shall serve
the Nibelung's son.

(A curtain which closes in the hall is drawn and
cuts the stage off from the audience.)

Scene Three

(The curtain is raised again. The rocky height as in
the prelude.)
(Brünnhilde sits at the entrance to the cave in
mute contemplation of Siegfried's ring. Touched by
joyful memories, she covers the ring with kisses.)
(Distant thunder is heard; she looks up and listens.
She turns again to the ring.)
(A flash of lightning. Brünnhilde listens again and
looks into the distance, where a dark thundercloud is
seen approaching.)

Brünnhilde
Sounds familiar of old
send to my ear a greeting.
A steed 'tis, hither winging his flight;
on the cloud it fares in storm to the fell.
Who seeks this lonely one here?

Waltraute
(from the distance) Brünnhilde!
Sister! Wake from thy slumber!

Brünnhilde
(starts from her seat)
Waltraute's call, how joyful the sound!
(calling to the wing) Com'st thou, sister?
Boldly ridest thou to me?
(She hastens to the edge of the rocks.)
There in the wood still dear to thee
light from thy horse,
and leave him there to take rest.
(She runs into the wood, from which a loud sound
like a thunderclap is heard. Brünnhilde comes back,
in violent agitation, with Waltraute; she remains in
joyful excitement, without observing Waltraute's
anxious fear.)
Com'st thou to me?
So bold art thou? Dar'st thou undaunted
bring thy greeting to me?

Waltraute
Thou alone art cause of my haste!

Brünnhilde
So rashly thou, dauntless in love,
Warfather's ban hast broken?
Or perchance! O say!
may I then hope Wotan's thought is changed?
When against the godhead Siegmund I guarded,
failing, I know it,
my deed fulfilled his desire.
That his anger is ended know I too.
For albeit he left me here,
fettered in sleep on the fell,
destined as thrall to the man

who should wake the maid in his path,
to my piteous prayer he granted grace:
with ravening fire he surrounded the fell,
to bar to all cravens the way.
So my blessing was born of my sentence:
the hero most famed hath won me for wife!
Blest by his love, in light and laughter I live.
(She embraces Waltraute with wild signs of joy,
which Waltraute attempts with impatience to
suppress.)
Lured wert thou, sister, by my lot?
Upon my joy wouldst thou also feed thee,
share all that I have won?

Waltraute
(vehemently) Share all the frenzy
that hath maddened thy brain?
In anguish of dread have I come
and broken Wotan's behest.
(Brünnhilde here first observes with surprise the
wildly excited condition of Waltraute.)

Brünnhilde
Pain and fear fetter thy spirit!
Then the god hath pardoned me not?
Thou fearest the punisher's wrath?

Waltraute
(gloomily) If still I feared it,
then at end were all my pain!

Brünnhilde
Wonder bewilders my sense.

Waltraute
Calm thou thy frenzy,
give good heed to my words!
To Walhall terror drives me again,
that from Walhall drove me to thee.

Brünnhilde
(frightened)
What is't that doth ail the eternals?

Waltraute
Hearken with heed to what I tell thee!
Since from thee Wotan turned him,
to battle no more hath he sent us:
dazed with fear, bewildered we rode to the field;
Walhall's heroes no more may meet Warfather.
Lonely to horse, without pause or rest,
as Wand'rer he swept thro' the world.
Home came he at last;
in his hand holding the spear-shaft's splinters:
a hero had struck it asunder.
With silent sign
Walhall's heroes sent he to hew
the world-ash-tree in pieces.
The sacred stem at his command was riven
and raised in a heap round about the hall of the
blest.
The holy host called he together;
the god on his throne took his place.

In dismay and fear at his word they assembled;
around him ranged, the hall was filled by his heroes.
So sits he, speaks no word,
on high enthroned grave and mute;
the shattered spear-shaft fast in his grasp;
Holda's apples tastes he no more.
Awestruck and shrinking sit the gods in silence.
Forth on quest from Walhall sent he his ravens;
if with good tidings back the messengers come,
then forever shall smiles of joy
gladden the face of the god.
Round his knees entwining cower we Valkyires;
nought recks he nor knows of our anguish:
we all are consumed
by terror and ne'er-ending fear.
Upon his breast weeping I pressed me;
(hesitating) then soft grew his look;
he remembered, Brünnhilde, thee!
He closed his eyes, deeply sighing,
and as in slumber spoke he the words:
if e'er the river maidens
win from her hand again the ring,
from the curse's load
released were god and world!
Then I took thought: and from his presence
through ranks all silent stealing away,
with secret haste I mounted my horse,
and rode in tumult to thee.
Now, o sister, to thee I pray:
what thou canst do, that dare to fulfill;
end all the grief of the gods!
(She has thrown herself down before Brünnhilde.)

Brünnhilde
(quietly)
What tales of evil fancies tellest thou, sad one, to me?
The cloudy heaven of gods on high
have I, poor fool, now escaped;
I grasp not what thou dost tell me.
Dark and wild seemeth thy speech:
and in thine eyes, so overweary,
gleams wavering fire.
With cheeks so pallid, thou white-faced sister,
what wouldst thou, wild one, from me?

Waltraute
(vehemently) Upon thy hand, the ring,
'tis that: hear but my rede:
for Wotan cast it from thee!

Brünnhilde
The ring? from me?

Waltraute
To the Rhine daughters give it again!

Brünnhilde
The Rhine daughters ... I ...
the ring? Siegfried's love pledge?
Lost are thy senses?

Waltraute
Hear me, hear my despair!
The world's ill-fate surely hangeth thereon.
Cast it from thee, away in the waters;
so shalt thou end Walhall's anguish:
the accurst thing fling in the flood!

Brünnhilde
Ha! know'st thou what 'tis to me?
How canst thou grasp it, loveless maid!
More than Walhall's rapture,
more than the fame of gods is this my ring:
one glance at its lustrous gold,
one flash of its holy fire
more is to me e'en than all the heaven's ayeenduring delight.
For blissfuly there shineth the love of Siegfried.
Love of Siegfried!
O might but its rapture be told thee!
that lives in the ring.
Go hence to the holy council of gods!
And of my ring tell o'er to them my words:
(rather more slowly) from love I never will turn,
of love they never shall rob me,
though into ruins
Walhall's splendor should fall!

Waltraute
This is thy truth then? So thou leavest
unloved in her sorrow thy sister?

Brünnhilde
Swiftly to horse! speed thee away!
The ring thou winn'st not from me!

Waltraute
Woe's me! Woe's me!
Woe to thee, sister!
Woe to Walhall's gods!
(She rushes away. A storm cloud soon rises from
the wood with thunder.)

Brünnhilde
(as she looks after the brightly illumined
thundercloud, which is soon quite lost in the
distance)
Borne on the wind
yon flashing storm cloud flyeth afar:
to me ne'ermore may it come!
(Evening has fallen. From below, the light of the
fire shines gradually brighter. Brünnhilde looks quiet-
ly out on the landscape.)
Twilight of evening hides the heaven;
brightly flameth the rampart of fire round the fell.
(The firelight approaches from below. Tongues of
flame, growing continually brighter, shoot up over
the rocky wall.)

Why leap so wildly
the blazing billows on high?
The mountaintop is girt by the fiery sea.
(She starts up in delight.)
Siegfried! Siegfried returned!
'Tis his call sounds in mine ears!
Up! Up! now to meet him!
clasped in the arm of my god!
(She hastens to the rocky parapet in the highest
delight. Flames shoot: from them springs Siegfried
forward on to a high rock: the flames immediately
draw back and shed their light only from below.)
(Siegfried, with the Tarnhem on his head, which
hides the upper half of his face, leaving only his eyes
free, appears in Gunther's form. Brünnhilde shrinks
back in terror, flies to the foreground, and from there
fixes here eyes in speechless astonishment on
Siegfried.)

Brünnhilde
Betrayed! Who cometh here?
(Siegfried, remaining on the stone at back and
leaning upon his shield, motionless, observes Brünn-
hilde.)

Siegfried
(with a feigned, rougher, voice)
Brünnhild'! A wooer comes,
whom thy fire doth not fright.
Thee seek I now for wife:
wilt freely follow me?

Brünnhilde
(trembling violently)
Who is the man who tempts undaunted
what the boldest only dares?

Siegfried
(as before)
A hero who shall tame thee
if force alone may serve.

Brünnhilde
A monster
standeth on yonder stone!
To rend me in pieces cometh an eagle!
Who art thou, awful one?
Art thou a mortal?
Com'st thou from Hella's darksome host?

Siegfried
(as before, beginning with a slightly
trembling voice, but presently continuing with
more certainty)
A Gibichung am I,
and Gunther is his name
whom thou shalt follow now.

Brünnhilde
(breaking out in despair)
Wotan! Thou ruthless, merciless god!
Woe! Now my sentence shines clear to me!
to shame and sorrow giv'st thou me o'er!
(Siegfried springs down from the stone and comes nearer.)

Siegfried
The night draws on: within thy cave
must thou to me be wedded!

Brünnhilde
(stretching out threateningly the finger
on which she carries Siegfried's ring)
Go back! Fear thou this token!
Thou shalt not force me to shame
so long as this ring is my guard.

Siegfried
Husband's right so shall be Gunther's:
let the ring make thee his wife!

Brünnhilde
Go back, thou robber! foolhardy thief!
defy not the might of my hand!
Stronger than steel makes me the ring:
ne'er shall it be thine!

Siegfried
From thee now to take it
teach me thy words!
(He presses toward her. They wrestle together.
Brünnhilde wrenches herself free, flies, and turns
around as if to defend herself. Siegfried seizes her
again. She flees; he reaches her. Both wrestle violently
together. He seizes her by the hand and draws the
ring from her finger. Brünnhilde shrieks violently.)

(As she sinks down into his arms, as if broken, her
unconscious look meets Siegfried's eyes. He lets her
fainting body slide down onto the stone bench at the
entrance to the cave.)
Now art thou mine.
Brünnhilde, Gunther's bride,
shew me the way to thy cave!
(Brünnhilde stares fainting before her.)

Brünnhilde
(exhausted)
How now canst thou help thee, ill-fated wife?
(Siegfried drives her on with a gesture of com-
mand. Trembling and with wavering steps she goes
into the cave.)
(Siegfried draws his sword.)

Siegfried
(in his natural voice)
Now, Nothung, witness thou
that I in bonds have wooed.
Keep thou my troth to my brother,
let thy blade safeguard his bride!
(He follows Brünnhilde.)
(The curtain falls.)

Act Two

Prelude and Scene One

(The curtain rises.)
(An open space on the shore in front of the Gibich-
ungs' hall: on the right the open entrance to the hall;
on the left the bank of the Rhine, from which,
slanting across the stage to the back, rises a rocky
height cut by several mountain paths. There Fricka's
altar stone is visible: higher up is a larger one for
Wotan, and on the side is another for Donner.)
(It is night. Hagen, with his arm around his spear
and his shield by his side, sits asleep, leaning against
one of the wooden pillars of the hall.)
(Here the moon suddenly shines out and throws a
vivid light on Hagen and the objects immediately sur-
rounding him; Alberich is seen crouching before him,
leaning his arms on Hagen's knees.)

Alberich
(softly) Sleep'st thou, Hagen, my son?
Thou sleep'st and hear'st me not,
whom rest and sleep betrayed?

Hagen
(softly, without moving, so that he appears to
sleep on, although his eyes are open)
Thy voice I hear, evil Niblung:
what hast thou now to tell my slumber?

Alberich
Forget not the might that thou possessest
if thou art valiant as they mother bore thee to me!

Hagen
(still as before)
Though might through her was mine,
no debt of thanks I owe her,
that prey she fell to thy craft:
old in youth, weak and wan, hating the happy,
ne'er am I glad!

Alberich
(as before)
Hagen, my son! Hate thou the happy!
This joyless and sorrow-laden one lov'st thou so
as thou shouldst.
Be thou crafty, strong and bold!
Those whom with weapons of darkness we fight,
e'en now are dismayed by our hate.
And he who ravished my ring,
Wotan, the ravenous robber,
by one of his heroes himself was vanquished:
through the Wälsung he lost dominion and
might;
with his clan of gods and heroes
in dread he waiteth his downfall.
I fear him no more:
sink will they all and perish!
Sleep'st thou, Hagen, my son?
(Hagen remains motionless as before.)

Hagen
The might of the gods,
who then shall win?

Alberich
I and thou! The world will be ours,
for in thy truth my faith is firm;
thou sharest my wrath and hate.
Wotan's spear was shattered by Siegfried,
and Fafner in fight before him hath fall'n
and left him as booty the ring;
power and might wieldeth the Wälsung:
Walhall and Nibelheim
(still mysteriously) bow before him.
On the boldest of heroes
in vain lies my curse;
for to him hath the ring no worth,
he knows nought of its wonderful might.
Laughing in ardor of love
burns his life aye away.
'Tis his undoing only can help us!
Sleep'st thou, Hagen, my son?

Hagen
(as before)
To work his undoing me doth he serve.

Alberich
The golden ring
must thou rob from the Wälsung!
A woman wise holdeth him in her love:
if by her rede to the Rhine's fair daughters,
who in wat'ry deeps my wisdom bewitched,
his hand should give back the ring, forever
lost were the gold,
and no wiles could win it again.
Then without stint strive thou for the ring!
I fostered thee fearless for this,
that against heroes safe thou shouldst hold me.
Though weak is my strength
to fight with the foe,
who as prey to Siegfried was doomed,
yet deadly hatred I bred in Hagen;
'tis his to avenge me, the ring to win me,
in Wälsung's and Wotan's despite!
Swear to me, Hagen, my son!
(From this point a gradually darkening shadow
again covers Alberich. At the same time morning
twilight begins.)

Hagen
(still as before)
The ring will I gain me; rest thou in peace!

Alberich
Swear to me, Hagen, my son!

Hagen
To myself swear I; trust thou and fear not!
(As, during the following bars, Alberich's form
gradually disappears, his voice becomes more and
more inaudible.)

Alberich
Be true, Hagen, my son!
Trusty hero! Be true! Be true! True!
(Alberich has quite disappeared. Hagen, who has
remained in the same position, looks, with fixed eyes
and without moving, toward the Rhine, over which
the light of dawn spreads itself.)

Scene Two

(From this point the Rhine becomes more and
more deeply colored by the glowing red of dawn.)
(Hagen makes a convulsive movement.)
(Siegfried comes suddenly from behind a bush
close to the shore.)

Siegfried
Hoiho, Hagen!
Weary man! Wake thou and greet me!
(Siegfried appears in his own shape, but has the
Tarnhelm on his head; he now takes this off and
hangs it on his girdle as he comes forward.)

Hagen
(rising leisurely)
Hei! Siegfried! Thou speedy hero!
Whence stormest thou now?

Siegfried
From Brünnhilde's rock!
'Twas there that the breath was drawn
that called thee but now,
so fast hither I flew.
Toiling more slowly a pair
by boat behind me to come!

Hagen
Then won is Brünnhild'?

Siegfried
Wakes Gutrune?

Hagen
(calling toward the hall) Hoiho! Gutrune!
Hither come! Siegfried is here:
why linger'st thou?

Siegfried
(turning to the hall)
Ye both shall hear the tale of Brünnhild's fate.
(Gutrune comes from the hall to meet him.)
Now give me welcome, Gibich maid!
for tidings good to thee I bear.

Gutrune
Freia greeteth thee
in name of woman's honor!

Siegfried
Freely grant thou grace to thy wooer!
for wife I have won thee today.

Gutrune
Then comes Brünnhild' with my brother?

Siegfried
Light was his wooing, I ween.

Gutrune
Came he unharmed through the fire?

Siegfried
Safe in its blaze had he been,
had I not dared it for him,
for so I sought to win thee.

Gutrune
But thee hath it not harmed?

Siegfried
I laughed in the tumult of flames.

Gutrune
Held Brünnhild' thee for Gunther?

Siegfried
Like were we to a hair:
the Tarnhelm served me well,
as Hagen truly foretold.

Hagen
I gave thee goodly redes.

Gutrune
Thy force tamed the valiant maid?

Siegfried
She felt Gunther's force.

Gutrune
And she gave herself to thee?

Siegfried
Through the night
the dauntless Brünnhild'
to her rightful husband belonged.

Gutrune
But the right in sooth was thine!

Siegfried
With Gutrune sojourned Siegfried.

Gutrune
But yet Brünnhild' lay beside him?

Siegfried
'Twixt the east and west
(pointing to his sword) the north:
so far was Brünnhild' from him.

Gutrune
How from thee came she to Gunther's arms?

Siegfried
Through the fast fading glow of the fire,
as day dawned, in the mist she followed me
down the vale;
when near the shore, soon the bridegroom's
place to Gunther I gave:
then by the Tarnhelm's magic wished myself
hither straight.
A driving wind now brings the lovers to Gibich's home.
Then welcome give to the pair.

Gutrune
Siegfried! Mightiest man!
I shrink with fear of thee!

Hagen
(calling from the shore)
From afar a sail draweth hither!

Siegfried
Then grant the herald thanks!

Gutrune
Let us give her worthy greeting,
that blithe and fain she here may tarry!
Thou, Hagen, call the men for the wedding
in Gibich's hall together!
Mirthful maids to the feast I call:
our merriment fain they would share!
(as she goes toward the hall, turning around again)
Wilt thou rest, faithless man?

Siegfried
Helping Gutrun' is my rest.
(He gives her his hand and goes into the hall with her.)

Scene Three

(Hagen has ascended a rock at the back; he seats
himself there and puts the cowhorn to his lips.)

Hagen
Hoiho! Hoiho hoho!
Ye Gibich vassals, gather ye here.
Arm ye! Arm ye! Weapons! Weapons!
Arm through the land!
Goodly weapons! Mighty weapons!
Sharp for strife! Need is here!
Need! Arm ye! Arm ye! Hoiho! Hoiho hoho!
(Hagen remains in the same position on the rock.
By different paths armed Vassals rush on hastily; first
singly, and then in continually increasing numbers
together.)

The Vassals
Why brays the horn?
Who calls us to arms?
We come with our arms.
We come with our weapons.
Hagen! Hagen! Hoiho! Hoiho!
Tell what need is here! Tell what foe is near!
Who brings us strife?
Hagen! Is Gunther in need?
Who is in need?
We come with our weapons,
with weapons sharp, with weapons of might.
Where is strife? Hoiho! Ho! Hagen!

Hagen
(still from the rock)
Arm yourselves well and loiter not!
Welcome give to your lord:
a wife Gunther has won.

Vassals
What is his need? Who is his foe?

Hagen
A Valkyrie wife bringeth he home.

Vassals
Her kinsmen and vassals follow in anger?

Hagen
Brünnhild' follows him; none beside.

Vassals
Then his peril is past?
Then the fight has been fought? Tell the tale!

Hagen
The dragon-slayer brought him the bride.
Siegfried, the hero, held Gunther safe!

A Vassal
Why call'st thou the host then together?

Ten Others
Why call'st thou then the host?

Hagen
Sturdy steers now shall ye slaughter;
on Wotan's altar pour forth their blood!

Vassals
What, Hagen, what more dost bid us do?
What more dost bid us do?
What do we then? What more dost bid us do?

Hagen
Then a boar I bid you strike down for Froh;
and a goat in his prime kill ye for Donner,
sheep I bid you slaughter for Fricka,
that grace she may grant to the marriage!

Vassals
(with increasing hilarity)
Say to us, Hagen, what then must we do?

Hagen
The drink-horn take that fairest women
with mead and wine gaily have filled!

Vassals
The drink-horn in hand,
what have we then to do?

Hagen
Freely carouse until tamed by drink.
So to the gods give all honor,
that grace they may grant to the marriage!
(The Vassals break out in ringing laughter.)

Vassals
Good hap and health greets now the Rhine,
if Hagen, the grim one, so merry may be!
The hedge's thorn pricks now no more;
as wedding herald plays he now his part.
(Hagen, who has remained very grave, has come
down to the Vassals and now stands among them.)

Hagen
Now cease your laughing, valiant vassals!
Receive Gunther's bride!
Brünnhilde nears there with him.
(He points toward the Rhine. Some of the Vassals
hasten to the height, while others arrange them-
selves on the shore to see the arrival.)
(coming nearer to some of the Vassals)
Love well your lady, faithfully help:
if she be wronged, swift be your vengeance!
(He turns slowly aside toward the back.)
(During the following, the boat with Gunther and
Brünnhilde approaches the shore of the Rhine.)

Vassals
Hail! Hail! Hail!
(Those who have been looking out from the height
come down to the shore.)
Hail! Be welcome! Be welcome!
(Some Vassals spring into the water and draw the
boat to land. All press closer to the bank.)

Hail! Be welcome, Gunther!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

Scene Four

(Gunther steps out of the boat with Brünnhilde:
the Vassals range themselves respectfully to receive
them. During the following Gunther ceremoniously
leads Brünnhilde forward by the hand.)

Vassals
Welcome, Gunther!
Health to thee and to thy bride!
Welcome, bridegroom, home and welcome bride!
Be welcome!
(They strike their weapons noisily together.)

Gunther
(presenting Brünnhilde, who follows him
with pale face and downcast eyes, to the Vassals)
Brünnhild', the fairest wife,
here to the Rhine I bring.
By man ne'er was won a nobler woman.
On Gibich's glorious race
shone ever grace from the gods;
to highest fame now shall we rise!

Vassals
(clashing their weapons)
Hail thou, happiest Gibichung!
(Gunther leads Brünnhilde, who has never raised
her eyes, to the hall, from which Siegfried and
Gutrune now come forth, attended by women.
Gunther stops before the hall.)

Gunther
I greet thee, hero mine,
and thee, lovely sister!
Gladly I see thee beside him
who now hath won thee for wife.
Two pairs in wedlock here shall find blessing:
(He draws Brünnhilde forward.)
Brünnhild' and Gunther, Gutrun' and Siegfried!
(Brünnhilde, startled, raises her eyes and sees
Siegfried; her look remains fixed on him as in aston-
ishment. Gunther, who has released Brünnhilde's
violently trembling hand, shows, as do all, blank
astonishment at Brünnhilde's behavior.)

Vassals
What ails her? What ails her?

Women
Is she distraught?
(Brünnhilde begins to tremble.)

Siegfried
(goes a few steps toward Brünnhilde)
What clouds Brünnhilde's brow?

Brünnhilde
(scarcely able to command herself)
Siegfried . here? Gutrune?

Siegfried
Gunther's gentle sister,
won by me as thou by him.

Brünnhilde
(with fearful vehemence)
I? Gunther? Thou liest!
(She appears about to fall. Siegfried supports her.)
Light fades from mine eyes.
(In Siegfried's arms, she looks faintly up at his
face.)
Siegfried knows me not?

Siegfried
Gunther, give thine aid to Brünnhild'!
(Gunther comes to them.)
Awaken, wife! Here stands thy husband.
(Brünnhilde perceives the ring on Siegfried's out-
stretched finger and starts with terrible vehemence.)

Brünnhilde
Ha! The ring upon his hand!
He? Siegfried?

Vassals
What is't? What is't?

Hagen
(coming from the back among the Vassals)
Now give good heed to the woman's tale!
(Brünnhilde tries to recover herself while she
forcibly restrains the most terrible excitement.)

Brünnhilde
On thy hand there I beheld a ring;
from me 'twas wrested, not by Siegfried
(pointing to Gunther) but by him!
How came then from him the ring to thy hand?
(Siegfried attentively observes the ring on his
finger.)

Siegfried
The ring came not to me from him.

Brünnhilde
(to Gunther)
Thou who didst rob the ring,
with which I wedded thee,
now let him know thy right;
take back again the pledge!

Gunther
(in great perplexity)
The ring? I gave him nothing:
yet dost thou know it well?

Brünnhilde
Where hidest thou the ring
that from my hand thou stolest?
(Gunther, greatly confused, is silent.)
(breaking out in violent passion)
Ha! He it was who from me did rob the ring.
Siegfried! the traitor and thief!

(All look expectantly at Siegfried, who is absorbed
in distant thoughts while contemplating the ring.)

Siegfried
No woman's hand gave me the ring,
nor woman was't from whom I wrested it:
I mind me well of the booty won,
when at Neidhöhl' fought was the fight,
and the mighty dragon I slew.

Hagen
(coming between them)
Brünnhild', dauntless wife!
know'st thou right well the ring?
Is't that Gunther took from thee? Then it is his,
and Siegfried hath won it by guile,
(rather broadly) that the traitor must now atone!

Brünnhilde
(shrieking out in most terrible anguish)
Betrayed! Betrayed! Shamefully betrayed!
Deceit! Deceit! Guile beyond all revenge.

Gutrune, Vassals, Women
Deceit? To whom?

Brünnhilde
Holy gods, ye heavenly rulers!
Have ye ordained this dark decree?
Ye who have doomed me to anguish so dire!
ye who have sunk me so deep in disgrace!
teach me such vengeance as ne'er was revealed!
stir in me wrath, that may never be stilled!
Let but Brünnhilde's heart now be broken;
bring her betrayer so to his death!

Gunther
Brünnhild', what say'st thou?
Calm thyself!

Brünnhilde
Away, betrayer,
self-betrayed one!
Hearken then, all men: know ye,
there standeth he whose wife am I.

Women
Siegfried? Wedded to her?

Vassals
Wedded to her?

Brünnhilde
He forced delight and love from me.

Siegfried
Thine own fair name dost hold so lightly?
The tongue, then, that reviles it
must I convict of its falsehood?
Say if I broke my faith!
Blood-brotherhood have I plighted to Gunther:
Nothung, my goodly sword,
guarded the holy vow:
its blade in honor parted
this ill-starred bride from me.

Brünnhilde
Thou crafty hero, see thy lie!
Vainly thou call'st as witness thy sword!
Its biting blade well know I,
the sheath too that wards it,
wherein as friend reposed on the wall
Nothung, the trusty sword,
when his true love was won by its lord.

(The Vassals and Women crowd together in indignation.)

Vassals
What? Siegfried a traitor?
Tainted is Gunther's honor?

Women
Siegfried a traitor?

Gunther
(to Siegfried)
My fame were sullied, stained with disgrace,
were not her slander cast in her teeth!

Gutrune
Faithless Siegfried, false to thine oath?
Bear witness that wrongly thou art charged!

Vassals
Right thyself now, if thou art wronged!
Silence her slander! Sworn be the oath!

Siegfried
Stilled be her slander!
Sworn be the oath!
Whose spear shall serve me as witness and ward?

Hagen
Here I hold my spear-point!
swear ye thereon:
your oath my weapon shall ward!
(The Vassals form a ring around Siegfried and
Hagen. Hagen holds out his spear; Siegfried lays two
fingers of his right hand upon the spear-point.)

Siegfried
Shining steel, hallowed weapon!
hold thou my oath in remembrance!
On this piercing spear-point sworn be my oath:
spear-point, witness my word!
If weapon e'er shall pierce me,
thine be the point;
whene'er death comes to strike me,
thine be the stroke.
if this her tale be true,
if to my friend I am false!
(Brünnhilde strides wrathfully into the ring, tears
Siegfried's hand away from the spear, and seizes the
point with her own.)

Brünnhilde
Shining steel! Hallowed weapon!
hold thou my oath in remembrance!
On this piercing spear-point sworn be my oath:
spear-point! witness my word!
Devoted be thy might to his undoing!
I pray that by thy point he may perish!
for broken are all his vows,
and falsehood now hath he sworn.

Vassals
Help, Donner! Send us thy thunder!
Help, Donner! Send us thy thunder,
to silence this crying disgrace!

Siegfried
Gunther! Look to the woman
who lying slanders thy name.
Grant her rest a while,
the tameless mountain maid,
till her unbridled rage be bated,
that by some demon's evil craft
here against all hath been roused!
Ye vassals, turn ye away!
leave the women to scold!
Like cravens gladly we yield
when 'tis a battle of tongues.
(He comes close to Gunther.)
Sooth, more vexed am I than thou
that ill was she beguiled;
the Tarnhelm, by its spell,
methinks but hid me half.
But women's spite swiftly is sped:
that for thee I have won her,
surely will she yet give thanks.
(He turns again to the Vassals.)
Follow, ye vassals, blithe to the feast!
(to the women)
Gaily, women, help at the wedding!
Let your delight laugh now aloud!
In house and field freest of light-hearts
shall ye find me today.
Ye whom love hath blest,
gaily share my gladness,
be ye as blithesome as I!
(Siegfried, in exuberant merriment, throws his arm
around Gutrune and draws her with him away into
the hall. The Vassals and Women, carried away by his
example, follow him.)
(The stage is cleared. Only Brünnhilde, Gunther
and Hagen remain behind. Gunther, with covered
face, has seated himself on one side in fearful
dejection. Brünn hilde, standing in the foreground,
looks for some time sadly after Siegfried and Gutrune,
then droops her head.)

Scene Five

Brünnhilde
(absorbed in meditation)
What demon's evil craft here lieth hidden?
What wizard's hateful spell stirred up this storm?
This knot to unravel where is my wisdom?
Where shall I discover runes for this riddle?
Oh sorrow! Sorrow! Woe's me! Woe's me!
All my wisdom gave I to him!
(with increasing emotion)

He holds the maid fast by his might;
he holds the booty fettered in bondage,
whom, wailing for her disgrace,
gaily he giveth away!
Who lendeth me now the sword
wherewith I may sever the bonds?

Hagen
(coming close to Brünnhilde)
Give me thy trust, betrayed wife!
I will avenge thy wrong on him.

Brünnhilde
(looking around wearily) On whom?

Hagen
On Siegfried, traitor to thee.

Brünnhilde
On Siegfried? thou? (smiling bitterly)
One single flash from his eye on thee glancing,
such as e'en through his lying disguise
looming glittered on me,
straight would cast dismay over thy daring!

Hagen
But on my spear-point
sworn was his falsehood?

Brünnhilde
Truth and falsehood, useless are words!
With stronger spells seek to arm thy weapon,
when at the strongest thou strik'st!

Hagen
Well know I Siegfried's conquering might,
how hard to slay him in battle;
then whisper me now some goodly rede
that he before me may fall.

Brünnhilde
O thankless, shameful return!
No single art to me was known
but his life is safe through its spell.
Unwitting he walks, by my charms enwound,
and now they hold him safe from harm.

Hagen
Then no weapon's point can pierce him?

Brünnhilde
In battle, none;
yet if at his back thou strike!
Never that knew I will he give way,
nor turn his back upon a foe-man:
and there I gave him no blessing.

Hagen
And there striketh my spear!
(He turns quickly from Brünnhilde to Gunther.)
Up Gunther, noble Gibichung!
Here stands thy valiant wife:
why giv st thou way to grief?

Gunther
(starting up passionately)
O shame! O sorrow!
Woe is me, of all men living the saddest!

Hagen
In shame thou liest; truth to tell.

Brünnhilde
(to Gunther)
O craven man! falsest of friends!
Hidden behind the hero wert thou,
that victory's guerdon he might win thee!
Deep had sunk the glorious race
that bore such faint-hearts as thou!

Gunther
(beyond himself)
Deceived am I, and deceiver!
Betrayed am I, and betrayer!
Now crushed be my bones,
and broken my heart!
Help, Hagen! Help for my honor!
Help for thy mother, for thee, too, did she bear!

Hagen
Here helps no brain, here helps not a hand,
nought helps but Siegfried's death!

Gunther
(seized with horror) Siegfried's death!

Hagen
Nought else purges thy shame!

Gunther
(staring before him)
Blood-brotherhood truly we swore!

Hagen
The broken bond blood shall atone!

Gunther
Broke he the bond?

Hagen
In betraying thee!

Gunther
Am I betrayed?

Brünnhilde
He betrayed thee;
and me ye all are betraying!
Were I but just, all the blood of the world
could not atone for your guilt!
But the death of one now shall content me.
Siegfried falleth atonement for guilt of all!

Hagen
(to Gunther)
His downfall (secretly) brings thee gain!
Might o'er all the world were thine,
if thou from him win the ring
that but death will wrest from his hand.

Gunther
(softly) Brünnhilde's ring?

Hagen
The Niblung's golden charm.

Gunther
(sighing deeply)
Must this be Siegfried's downfall?

Hagen
His death will serve us all.

Gunther
Yet Gutrune, ah! whom he has wedded!
How should we stand before her,
with his blood upon our hands?

Brünnhilde
(starting up in a rage)
What redes have told me,
what runes have shewn me,

through heartbreaking anguish shineth now clear:
Gutrune is the (passionately) spell
whereby my hero was beguiled.
Ill-fate be hers!

Hagen
(to Gunther)
If this dole must be dealt her,
then hidden be the deed.
We hie tomorrow merrily hunting;
the hero, struck by a boar,
may haply come by his death.

Gunther
So shall it be! perish Siegfried!

Brünnhilde
So shall it be: perish Siegfried!

Gunther
Purged be the shame cast by his crime!

Hagen
So shall he fall, the hero so famed!

Brünnhilde
Purged be the shame
cast by his crime!

Hagen
Mine is the hoard,
my hand aye shall hold it.
My hand aye shall hold it:
from him the ring shall be wrested!
Hearken, father, thou fallen prince!
Night-warder! Nibelung lord!
Alberich! Look thou on me!
Call now anew on the Nibelung host,
bid them obey thee, the lord of the ring!

Gunther
The oath of brotherhood hath he broken:

Brünnhilde
Holiest vows hath he broken:

Both
And with his blood let him atone
All-seeing god of revenge!
Oath-witness and lord of vows!
Wotan! Turn thee to me!
Call on thine awful heavenly host,
bid them give ear to the vow of revenge!
(As Gunther turns impetuously with Brünnhilde to
the hall, the bridal procession issuing therefrom
meets them. Boys and girls, waving branches of
flowers, leap joyously in front. Siegfried on a shield
and Gutrune on a seat are borne by the men. On the
rising ground at the back men- and women-servants
take implements and animals for sacrifice by various
mountain paths to the altars, which they adorn with
flowers. Siegfried and the Vassals sound the wedding
call on their horns.)
(The Women invite Brünnhilde to accompany
them to Gutrune's side. Brünnhilde stares blankly at
Gutrune, who beckons her with a friendly smile. As
Brünnhilde is about to step back impetuously, Hagen
steps in and forces her toward Gunther, who seizes
her again, whereupon he allows himself to be raised
on a shield by the Vassals.)
(As the procession, scarcely interrupted, quickly
puts itself again in motion toward the height, the
curtain falls.)

Act Three

Prelude and Scene One

(The curtain rises. A wild, woody and rocky valley
on the Rhine, which flows past a steep cliff in the
background.)
(The three Rhine daughters, Woglinde, Wellgunde
and Flosshilde, rise to the surface and swim about,
circling as in a dance.)

The Rhine Daughters
(pausing in their swimming)
Fair sunlight sendeth rays of splendor;
night lies in the waters.
Bright were they once when through the waves
the radiant sun gleamed on the Rhine-gold.
Rhine-gold, shining gold,
how bright was once thy luster,
beauteous star of the waters!
(They swim about again as in a dance.)
Weialala, weialala heia leia wallala la
heia la la lei la la la la la la lei,
walla la la la weia la wallala weia la
la la wallala la la leia leia leia leia la la la!
(Distant horn call. They listen. They joyously splash
in the water.)
Fair sunlight, send us now the hero,
who again our gold shall give us!
Let it be ours, then thy bright eye
no more will awaken our longing!
Rhine-gold! Shining gold,
how fair then thy luster,
glorious star of the waters!
(Siegfried's horn is heard on the heights.)

Woglinde
I hear now his horn.

Wellgunde
The hero comes.

Flosshilde
Let us take counsel!
(All three dive down quickly.)
(Siegfried appears on the cliff, fully armed.)

Siegfried
Some elf hath led me astray,
and now the track I have lost.
Hey, rogue! What rocky cave has hidden so
quickly my game?
(The three Rhine daughters rise to the surface and
swim as in a dance.)

Rhine Daughters
Siegfried!

Flosshilde
Why scold'st thou so at the rocks?

Wellgunde
Hath a fairy roused thine ire?

Woglinde
Or hath an elf played thee false?

All Three
Tell us, Siegfried, speak to us.

Siegfried
(smilingly regarding them)
Have ye then lured away the shaggy-hided fellow
whom I have lost?
Is he your sweetheart?
then, frolicsome maids, I leave him to you.
(The maidens laugh.)

Woglinde
Siegfried, what giv'st thou us,
if we thy game should grant thee?

Siegfried
Nought have I won today:
so ask of me what ye will!

Wellgunde
A golden ring gleams on thy finger:

Rhine Daughters
That give us!

Siegfried
From a dragon fierce
I gained the ring in fight,
and for a worthless bearskin shall I
give it you now as price?

Woglinde
Art thou so mean?

Wellgunde
So miserly, too?

Flosshilde
Free-handed aye with maids shouldst thou be!

Siegfried
On you if I waste my goods,
belike then my wife will scold.

Flosshilde
Is she a shrew?

Wellgunde
She strikes perchance?

Woglinde
Hath the hero felt her hand?
(They laugh immoderately.)

Siegfried
Now laugh ye gaily on!
In grief will ye be left:
the ring ye fondly crave
your mocking never shall win!
(The Rhine daughters have again joined hands for the dance.)

Flosshilde
So fair!

Wellgunde
So strong!

Woglinde
So worthy love!

All Three
How sad that he a miser is!

(They laugh and dive down.)
(Siegfried comes lower down.)

Siegfried
Why must I brook their idle mocks?
Shall I bear this shame?
Let them but come to the shore again,
the ring then would I give them.
(calling loudly) Hey! Hey hey!
Ye merry water-maidens!
Come now! I grant you the ring!
(He has drawn the ring from his finger and holds it
on high. The Rhine daughters rise again to the
surface. They appear grave and solemn.)

Flosshilde
Then keep it still and ward it well,
till thou the ill-fate hast found,

Wog., Well.
that in the ring lies hid,

All Three
Right fain wilt thou then
be freed by us from the curse.

Siegfried
(quietly places the ring again on his finger)
Then sing me what ye know.

Rhine Daughters
Siegfried! Siegfried! Siegfried!
Evil fate we foresee.

Wellgunde
For thine own ill-hap hold'st thou the
ring.

Well., Floss.
From the Rhine's pure gold

All Three
was the ring once wrought:

Wellgunde
He who craftily shaped it

Woglinde
and lost it in shame,

Wog., Well.
laid a curse thereon

All Three
for time to come, that doometh
its lord surely to death.

Flosshilde
As thou slew' st the dragon

Well., Floss.
shalt thou be slain

All Three
and here, today: so now we foretell,
if thou the ring wilt not yield

Well., Floss.
to rest for aye in the waters.

All Three
This stream alone stayeth the curse!

Siegfried
Ye wily women, hold your peace!
If your craft could not catch me,
by your threats still less will ye fright me!

Rhine Daughters
Siegfried! Siegfried!
We counsel thee well.
Turn thee! Turn from the curse!
By Norns at dead of night was it
woven in the rope of fate's decrees!

Siegfried
My sword once shattered a spear:
the endless rope of fate's decrees,
if in its strands a curse hath been spun,
Nothung shall cut it asunder!
A dragon once warned me to flee the curse,
but yet fear he brought not to me.
(He contemplates the ring.)
The world's wealth hath a ring on me bestowed:
for the grace of love had it been yours,
and by your grace yet were it gained.
But when limbs ye threaten and life,
e'en tho' a finger outweigh its worth,
from me ye wrest not the ring.
My limbs and my life, see:
(He lifts a clod of earth from the ground, holds it
over his head, and with the last words throws it
behind him.)
so freely I fling away!

Rhine Daughters
Come, sisters!
Speed from the madman!
Though valiant and wise he seems to himself,
though valiant and wise he seems to himself,
yet in bonds and in blindness is he!
(They swim, wildly excited, in wide circles close to
the shore.)
Oaths he plighted, and heedeth them not!
(Renewed animated movement.)
Runes he readeth, and recks them not!

Flosshilde
A glorious gift once was his own:

Woglinde
A glorious gift once was his own:

All Three
That he has lost it knows he not;

Flosshilde
but the ring,

Wellgunde
that will deal him death,

All Three
the ring he will not surrender!
Farewell! Siegfried! A woman proud
will this day they wealth inherit;
our prayer by her will be heard:
to her!
(They turn quickly to their dance, in which they
slowly swim away to the back. Siegfried looks after
them, smiling, then places one foot on a piece of rock
on the shore and stands with his chin resting on his
hand.)

Rhine Daughters
Weialala weialala
leia leia wallala la la lei
la la la lei la la la la la la lei
(more and more distant) walla la la la weia
la walla la weiala la lei wallala
la la leia leia leia leia la la la!

Siegfried
Alike on land and water
women's ways I now have learned:
the man who defies their smiles
they seek by threats to frighten;
if then he scorn their threats,
they sting him with scolding tongues!
(The Rhine daughters have now quite disappeared.)
And yet, but for my plighted oath,...
(The Rhine daughters are heard in the far
distance.)

Rhine Daughters
La! la!

Siegfried
... of these so winsome maids,
full sure had one soon been mine!
(He looks calmly after them.)
(Hunting horns are heard from the heights.)

Hagen
(far offstage) Hoiho!
(Siegfried starts from a dreamy reverie and
answers the call with his horn.)

Scene Two

Vassals
(offstage) Hoiho?
Hoiho? Hoiho?

Siegfried
(answering) Hoiho! Hoiho hoihe!
(Hagen appears on the height. Gunther follows
him.)

Hagen
(seeing Siegfried) Found is the place, then,
where thou hast hidden?

Siegfried
Come ye down! Here 'tis fresh and cool!
(The Vassals all come to the height and now come
down with Hagen and Gunther.)

Hagen
Here rest we now; make ready the meal!
(They lay the game in a heap.)
Lay down the booty,
and bring out the wineskins!
(Wineskins and drink-horns are produced.
All lie down.)
The game from us he hunted;
be now the wonders told us
of Siegfried and his chase.

Siegfried
Ill fares it with my meal:
to share your booty e'en must I now beg.

Hagen
No booty thine?

Siegfried
For wood-game went I forth,
but waterfowl only I found:
yet had I been fitly furnished,
a brood of waterbirds to you had I brought as booty,
who sang to my ears ill tidings,
that slain today should I be.
(Gunther starts and looks darkly at Hagen.)
(Siegfried lies down between Gunther and Hagen.)

Hagen
That were an ill-starred chase,
if a lurking beast should change
to slay the luckless hunter.

Siegfried
I thirst now!

Hagen
(while a drink-horn is filled for Siegfried,
which Hagen then offers to him)
I heard it rumored, Siegfried,
that when the birds are singing
their speech thou dost know:
can that be the truth?

Siegfried
Their singing long have I heeded no more.
(He grasps the drink-horn and turns with it to
Gunther. He drinks and offers the horn to Gunther.)
Drink, Gunther, drink:
thy brother brings the draught!
(Gunther looks into the horn with horror.)

Gunther
(moodily) The draught is poor and pale:
(more gloomily) thy blood alone is there!

Siegfried
(laughing)
Then let our blood be mingled!
(He pours from Gunther's horn into his own so
that it overflows.)
Now mixed the wine runs over:
to earth, our mother, a cordial let it be!

Gunther
(with a deep sigh)
Thou overjoyous man!

Siegfried
(low, to Hagen)
His mirth Brünnhilde mars!

Hagen
(low, to Siegfried)
Her voice is not so clear as song of birds to thee!

Siegfried
Since women their songs have sung me,
the birds have I clean forgot.

Hagen
Yet once thou heard'st them well?

Siegfried
(turning to Gunther with animation)
Hey, Gunther, gloomy man!
Give me thy thanks,
and tales of the days of my boyhood will I tell thee.

Gunther
My thanks be thine.
(All lie down near Siegfried, who alone sits
upright.)

Hagen
Now sing to us.

Siegfried
Mime, know ye then, was a dwarf:
he had fostered me, driven by greed,
that, grown to strength, for him I might slay
in the wood a dragon grim,
who lay there guarding a hoard.
So smithing he taught me
and forging sword blades;
the task the craftsman ne'er could achieve,
the learner's cunning yet had to master:
out of a shattered weapon's splinters,
new to fashion a sword.
My father's blade forged I anew.
Ne'er was steel stronger than Nothung.
Fit for the fight then it was deemed;
together we sought the wood:
there slew I Fafner, the foe.
Now let your ears heed well my tale:
marvels have I to tell you.
From the dragon's blood my fingers were burning;
I raised them straight to my mouth:
but when the blood scarce had wetted my tongue,
then what the birds were singing
I seemed to hear like speech.
On a branch one sat there and sang:
"Hei! Siegfried now owneth the Nibelung's hoard,
if hid in the cavern the hoard he finds!
Let him but win him the Tarnhelm,
'twill serve him for deeds of renown:
but could he discover the ring,
it would make him the lord of the world!"

Hagen
Ring and Tarnhelm took'st thou away?

A Vassal
Again then heard'st thou the woodbird?

Siegfried
Ring and Tarnhelm when I had seized,
then once again I gave ear to the warbler;
he sat above me and sang:
"Hei! Siegfried now owneth the helm and the ring.
Oh, let him not trust to the falsest of friends!
for Mime too covets the hoard
and now craftily lurks on the road:
to his death he lureth on Siegfried:
let Siegfried trust not in Mime!"

Hagen
The warning was good?

Four Vassals
Got Mime his payment?

Siegfried
With murderous drink he came to my side;
shy and shaking, he told me his falseness:
Nothung paid him his wage!

Hagen
(laughing harshly)
He forged not the sword yet soon did he feel it!
(He has another drink-horn filled and drops the
juice of an herb into it.)

A Vassal
What more didst hear from the woodbird?

Another Vassal
What more didst hear from the woodbird?

Hagen
Drink first, hero, from my horn:
I mixed thee a noble draught,
that its magic may wake thy remembrance,
(He offers Siegfried the horn.)
and old times may not escape thee!
(Siegfried looks thoughtfully into the horn and
then drinks slowly.)

Siegfried
In grief to the branches gazed I aloft;
there still he sat and sang:
"Hei! Siegfried hath struck down the evil dwarf!
Now know I for him a glorious bride:
on rocky fastness she sleeps,
guarded by fire is her home:
who fighteth the flames, wakens the maid,
Brünnhilde wins for his own!"

Hagen
The woodbird's counsel didst thou follow?

Siegfried
Straight, without pause I hied me away:
(Gunther listens with increasing astonishment.)
till the flaming fell I reached:
I passed through its fire and found for prize,
(sinking more and more into a state of ecstasy)
sleeping, a woman fair,
all clad in glittering mail.
The helm I loosed from the glorious maid,
my kiss awoke her from sleep:
ah, then like flames of fire
enfolded me beauteous Brünnhilde's arms!

Gunther
(springing up in greatest dismay)
What saith he?

(Two ravens fly up out of a bush, circle over Sieg-
fried, and then fly away toward the Rhine.)

Hagen
Those raven's speech! canst thou read it aright?
(Siegfried stands up suddenly and, turning his
back to Hagen, looks after the ravens.)
Vengeance is their decree!
(Hagen thrusts his spear into Siegfried's back.
Gunther and the Vassals rush toward Hagen. Sieg-
fried swings his shield on high with both hands, as
though to throw it upon Hagen: his force fails him,
the shield falls backward, and he himself falls down
on the shield.)

Four Vassals
(who have in vain tried to hold Hagen back)
Hagen, what dost thou?

Two other Vassals
What deed is that?

Gunther
Hagen, what deed is that?

Hagen
Falsehood's payment!
(Hagen turns quietly away and then is seen
through the gathering twilight slowly moving up the
height, over which he disappears. Gunther bends
down, stricken with grief, at Siegfried's side. The
Vassals stand around the dying man, filled with
sympathy.)

Siegfried
(held by two Vassals in a sitting position,
opens his eyes)
Brünnhilde! Holiest bride!
Awake! Lift up thine eyelids!
Who hath locked thee once more in sleep?
Who bound thee in slumber so fast?
Thy wak'ner came: he kissed thee awake,
again now the bridge's bonds hath he broken:
now laughs to him Brünnhild's delight.
Ah! those eyes ever now open!
Ah, what enchantment wafteth her breathing!
Blissful surrender, sweet are they terrors!
Brünnhild' greeteth me there!
(He sinks back and dies. The rest stand around him
in sorrow without moving.)
(Night has come. At Gunther's mute command the
Vassals raise Siegfried's corpse and, during the
following, carry it away in solemn procession over the
height. Gunther follows at a little distance.)
(The moon breaks through the clouds and lights
up the funeral procession more and more brightly as
it reaches the height. Mists have arisen from the
Rhine and gradually fill the whole stage, where the
funeral procession has become invisible: they come
quite to the front, so that the whole stage remainshidden during the musical interlude.)
(From this point the mists divide again, until at
length the hall of the Gibichungs appears, as in Act One.)

Scene Three

(It is night. The moonlight is reflected from the
Rhine. Gutrune comes out from her room into the hall.)

Gutrune
Was that his horn? (She listens.)
No! He cometh not yet.
Dreams of evil drove away my sleep.
Then wildly neighs his horse;
Brünnhild's laughter in waking I heard.
What woman was't
that to the shore I saw go down!
I shrink from Brünnhild'. Is she within?
(She listens at the door to the right and calls:)
Brünnhild'! Brünnhild'! Art awake?
(She opens the door hesitatingly and looks into
the inner room.)
Bare is her room. Then it was she
who to the river shore went down?
(Horn on the stage, distant.)
Was that his horn? No! All silent!
(She looks anxiously out.)
Would but Siegfried return!

Hagen
(from offstage, coming nearer)
Hoiho! Hoiho!
(As Gutrune hears Hagen's voice she stands for a
time motionless with fear.)
Awake! Awake!
Torches, torches, burning torches!
Home bring we spoils of our hunt.
Hoiho! Hoiho!
(Increasing fire-glow from offstage. Hagen enters
the hall.)
Up, Gutrun'! Give Siegfried greeting!
Thy hero bold now cometh home.

Gutrune
(in great terror)
What befell? Hagen! I heard not his horn!
(Men and women in great confusion, with lights
and firebrands, accompany the procession returning
home with Siegfried's body.)

Hagen
Thy pale-faced hero will wind it no more;
to fight or to hunt no more will he hie,
no more will he woo winsome women.

Gutrune
(with growing horror)
What bring hey here?
(The procession reaches the middle of the hall, and
the Vassals set down the body on a hastily raised
mound.)

Hagen
'Tis a boar's ill-fated victim:
Siegfried, thy husband, slain.
(Gutrune shrieks out and falls upon the corpse.
General horror and mourning. Gunther tends
Gutrune.)

Gunther
Gutrun', gentle sister,
look thou upon me, speak but to me!

Gutrune
(coming to herself again.)
Siegfried ... Siegfried is murdered!
(She pushes Gunther back violently.)
Hence! hence, faithless brother!
'tis thou hast slain my husband,
Oh help me! Help me! Sorrow! Sorrow!
My hero, Siegfried, is murdered!

Gunther
Cast not the blame on me,
cast there the blame on Hagen.
He is the accursed traitor
by whom this hero was slain.

Hagen
Art therefor wroth with me?

Gunther
Grief and ill-fate thine be forever!

Hagen
(stepping forward with terrible defiance)
Yes then! 'Tis I that did slay him.
I, Hagen, dealt him his death.
To my spear was he decreed,
whereon his false oath was sworn.
Holiest heritage have I by right now won me:
Therefore I claim here this ring.

Gunther
Away! What I have won,
that thou shalt ne'er make thine!

Hagen
Ye vassals, give me my right.

Gunther
Graspest thou Gutrune's dower,
shameless Niblung son?
(Hagen draws his sword.)

Hagen
The Niblung's dower so his son doth seize.
(He rushes upon Gunther, who defends himself;
they fight. The Vassals throw themselves between.
Gunther falls dead from a stroke of Hagen's.)
Mine, the ring!
(He grasps at Siegfried's hand, which raises itself
threateningly. Gutrune shrieks with horror as Gunther
falls. All remain motionless with terror.)
(From the background Brünnhilde advances firmly
and solemnly to the front.)

Brünnhilde
(still in the background)
Silence your sorrow's clamorous cry!
Whom ye all have betrayed,
for vengeance cometh his wife.
(as she quietly comes farther forward)
Children heard I whining to their mother
because sweet milk had been spilled:
yet heard I not lament that befitteth
the highest hero's fame.

Gutrune
(raising herself from the ground)
Brünnhilde! Envy-cursed one!
Thou hast on us brought this bane,
for thou didst rouse the men against him;
woe, that to this house thou cam'st!

Brünnhilde
Ill-starred one, peace!
for ne'er wert thou wife of his;
his leman alone hast thou been.
His manhood's bride am I:
to me all his vows had been sworn
ere Siegfried looked on thy face!

Gutrune
(breaking out in sudden despair)
Accursed Hagen! that thou the poison gav'st
that has stol'n her husband away!
Ah, sorrow! Mine eyes are opened,
Brünnhild' was the true love
whom through the drink he forgot!
(Full of shame, she has turned away from Siegfried
and bends over Gunther's body in a dying condition;
so she remains, motionless, till the end. Hagen
stands, defiantly leaning on his spear, sunk in gloomy
brooding, on the opposite side.)
(Brünnhilde alone in the center: after remaining
long absorbed in contemplation of Siegfried, she
turns now to the men and women with solemn
exaltation.)

Brünnhilde
(to the Vassals)
Mighty logs I bid you now pile
on high by the river shore!
Bright and fierce kindle a fire;
let the noblest hero's corse in its flames be
consumed.
His steed bring to me here,
that with me his lord he may follow:
for my body burneth with holiest longing my
hero's honor to share.
Fulfill Brünnhild's behest.
(During the following, the young men raise a huge
funeral pyre of logs before the hall, near the bank of
the Rhine: women decorate this with coverings on
which they strew plants and flowers.)
(Brünnhilde becomes again absorbed in contemplation
of Siegfried's dead face. Her features take
gradu ally a softer and brighter expression.)

Like rays of sunshine streameth his light:
the purest was he, who hath betrayed!
In wedlock traitor, true in friendship;
from his heart's own true love, only beloved one,
barred was he by his sword.
Truer than his were oaths ne'er spoken;
faithful as he, none ever held promise;
purer than his, love ne'er was plighted:
Yet oaths hath he scorned, bonds hath he broken,
the faithfullest love none so hath betrayed!
Know ye why that was?
(looking upward)
Oh ye, of vows the heavenly guardians!
Turn now your eyes on my grievous distress;
behold your eternal disgrace!
To my plaint give ear, thou mighty god!
Through his most valiant deed,
by thee so dearly desired,
didst thou condemn him to endure
the doom that on thee had fallen;
he, truest of all, must betray me,
that wise a woman might grow!
Know I now all thy need?
All things, all things, all now know I.
All to me is revealed.
Wings of thy ravens wave around me;
with tidings long desired,
I send now thy messengers home.
Rest thou, rest thou, o god!
(She makes a sign to the Vassals to lift Siegfried's
body onto the pyre; at the same time she draws the
ring from Siegfried's finger and looks at it meditatively.)

My heritage yields now the hero.
Accursed charm! Terrible ring!
My hand grasps thee, and gives thee away.
Ye sisters wise who dwell in the waters,
give ear, ye sorrowing Rhine maids,
good counsel lives in your redes:
what ye desire I leave to you:
now from my ashes take ye your treasure!
Let fire, burning this hand,
cleanse, too, the ring from its curse!
Ye in the flood, wash it away,
and purer preserve your shining gold
that to your sorrow was stol'n.
(She has put the ring on her finger and now turns
to the pile of logs on which Siegfried's body lies
stretched. She takes a great firebrand
from one of the men.)
(waving the firebrand and pointing to the
background)
Fly home, ye ravens! tell your lord the tidings
that here on the Rhine ye have learned!
To Brünnhilde's rock first wing your flight!
there burneth Loge:
straight way bid him to Walhall!
For the end of godhood draweth now near.
So cast I the brand
on Walhall's glittering walls.
(She flings the brand on the woodpile, which
quickly breaks out into bright flames. Two ravens fly
up from the rock and disappear in the background.)
(Brünnhilde perceives her horse, which has just
been led in by two men.)
Grane, my steed, I greet thee, friend!

(She has sprung toward him, seizes and unbridles
him: then she bends affectionately toward him.)
Know'st thou now to whom
and whither I lead thee?
In fire radiant, lies there thy lord,
Siegfried, my hero blest.
To follow thy master, joyfully neigh'st thou?
Lures thee to him the light with its laughter?
Feel, too, my bosom, how it doth burn;
glowing flames now lay hold on my heart:
fast to enfold him, embraced by his arms,
in might of our loving with him aye made one!
Heiajaho! Grane! Give him thy greeting!
(She has swung herself on the horse and urges it to
spring forward.)

Siegfried! Siegfried! See!
Brünnhild' greets thee in bliss.

(She makes her horse leap into the burning pile of
logs. The flames immediately blaze up so that they fill
the whole space in front of the hall and appear to
seize on the building itself. The men and women
press to the front in terror.)

(As the whole space of the stage seems filled with
fire, the glow suddenly subsides, so that only a cloud
of smoke remains, which is drawn to the background
and there lies on the horizon as a dark bank of cloud.
At the same time the Rhine overflows its banks in a
mighty flood which rolls over the fire. On the waves
the three Rhine daughters swim forward and now
appear on the place of the fire.)
(Hagen, who since the incident of the ring has
observed Brünnhilde's behavior with growing
anxiety, is seized with great alarm at the appearance
of the Rhine daughters. He hastily throws spear,
shield and helmet from him and rushes, as if mad,
into the flood.)

Hagen
Give back the ring!

(Woglinde and Wellgunde embrace his neck with
their arms and draw him with them into the depths
as they swim away. Flosshilde, swimming in front of
the others toward the back, holds up the regained
ring joyously.)
(Through the bank of clouds which lie on the
horizon a red glow breaks forth with increasing
brightness. Illumined by this light, the three Rhine
daughters are seen, swimming in circles, merrily play-
ing with the ring on the calmer waters of the Rhine,
which has gradually returned to its natural bed.)

(From the ruins of the fallen hall, the men and
women, in the greatest agitation, look on the
growing firelight in the heavens. As this at length
glows with the greatest brightness, the interior of
Walhall is seen, in which the gods and heroes sit
assembled, as in Waltraute's description in the first act.)
(Bright flames appear to seize on the hall of the
gods. As the gods become entirely hidden by the
flames, the curtain falls.)
