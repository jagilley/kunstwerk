ACT ONE

PRELUDE

SCENE ONE

Isolde. Brangaene.

(Voice of a young sailor)

(Tent-like cabin on the fore-deck of a sea-going ship, richly hung with tapestries, at first drawn together upstage; at one side a narrow companion-way leads down to the lower deck of the ship. Isolde on a couch, her face hidden in the cushions. Brangaene, holding a curtain to one side, looking over the rail out to sea)

VOICE OF A YOUNG SAILOR
(heard from a height, as if from the masthead)
Westwards
the gaze wanders;
eastwards
skims the ship.
Fresh the wind blows
towards home:
my Irish child,
where are you now?
Is it your wafting sighs
that swell my sails?
Blow, blow, you wind!
Ah, alas, my child!
Irish girl,
you wild, adorable girl!

ISOLDE
(sturting up sharply)
Who dares to mock me?

(She looks about her, distractedly)

Brangaene, you?
Tell me, where are we?

BRANGÄNE
(at the opening)
Blue shadows
are rising up in the east;
smoothly and swiftly
the ship sails on:
on a calm sea, before evening,
we shall safely reach land.

ISOLDE
Which land?

BRANGÄNE
Cornwall's green coast.

ISOLDE
Never!
Not today, not tomorrow!

BRANGÄNE
(lets the curtain fall back
and hurries anxiously to Isolde)

What are you saying? My mistress! Ah!

ISOLDE
(with suppressed rage)
Degenerate race!
Unworthy of your ancestors!
How, o Mother,
did you dispose of the power
of ruling sea and tempest?
O feeble art
of the sorceress,
still cooking up curative potions!
Be stirred in me once again,
bold power;
rise up from my breast
where you have lain concealed!
Give ear to my will,
half-hearted winds!
Off to battle
and turbulent elements!
To the furious vortex
of raging tempests!
Shake from her slumber
this somnolent sea,
awaken from her depths
her malevolent greed!
Show her the prize
that I have to offer!
Let her smash this insolent ship
and gorge on her shattered wreckage!
And whatever has life on her,
that faint breath
I leave as reward for you winds!

BRANGÄNE
(in utmost terror,
anxiously attending Isolde)

Alas!
Ah! Ah!
The evil that I foresaw!
Isolde! My lady!
Dear heart!
What have you been keeping from me for so long?
Not a tear
did you shed for father and mother;
scarcely a parting word
did you have for those left behind.
Leaving your homeland,
cold and mute,
pale and silent
on the voyage;
without food,
without sleep,
numb and wretched,
wild and distraught.
How could I bear
to see you thus,
to mean nothing to you,
to stand before you as a stranger?
Oh tell me now
what troubles you!
Let me know
what is tormenting you!
My lady Isolde,
dearest beloved!
If she is to hold herself of worth in your eyes,
place your trust in Brangaene now.

ISOLDE
Air! Air!
My heart is stifled!
Open up! Open wide there!

(Brangaene quickly draws back the centre custain)

SCENE TWO

The previous characters. Tristan. Kurwenal. Sailors. Knights and Squires.

(The length of the ship can be seen as far as the helm and over the stern out to sea towards the horizon. Sitting on deck around the main mast are sailors working on the rigging lines; beyond them, on the poop, can be seen knights and squires at rest; at some distance from them stands Tristan, his arms folded, gazing pensively out to sea; at his feet reclines Kurwenal, relaxed.)

From above, from the masthead
we hear again the

VOICE OF THE YOUNG SAILOR

Freshly the wind blows
towards home:
my Irish child,
where are you now?
Is it your wafting sighs
that swell my sails?
Blow, blow, you wind!
Ah, alas, my child!

ISOLDE
(whose gaze immediatly falls on Tristan,
and remains coldly fixed on him,
to herself in a hollow voice)

Chosen for me,
lost to me,
splendid and strong,
bold and cowardly!
Head destined for death!
Heart destined for death!

(to Brangaene, with a dismal laugh)

What do you think of the upstart?

BRANGÄNE
(following her gaze)
Whom do you mean?

ISOLDE
The hero there,
diverting his gaze
from mine,
in shame and awe
his eyes cast down.
Tell me, how does he strike you?

BRANGÄNE
Do you mean Tristan,
dear lady,
the marvel of all kingdoms,
supremely acclaimed above all others,
the hero without peer,
the shield and guardian of reputation?

ISOLDE
(mocking her)
Who timidly flees
from the blow whenever he can,
because he has won a corpse as a bride
for his master!
Do you think it sinister,
my tale?
Ask him yourself, then,
the free man,
whether he dares to approach me!
This bashful hero forgets
the correct address demanded by honour
and well-bred attention
to his mistress,
lest her gaze fall upon him,
the hero without peer.
Oh, he knows
well why!
To the proud one go
and tell him what your mistress says:
ready to attend me,
he is to come to me at once.

BRANGÄNE
Am I to ask him
to bid you greeting?

ISOLDE
Let my command
teach the vainglorious one
to fear his mistress,
Isolde!

(At Isolde's premptory wave Brangaene withdraws and, abashed, walks along the deck, past the crew at their work, to the helm. Isolde, following her with a wild gaze, moves back towards the couch, where she remains seated during the following action, her eyes unswervingly fixed on the helm)

KURWENAL
(who sees Brangaene coming,
tugs, without getting up,
at Tristan's garment)

Watch out, Tristan,
an envoy from Isolde.

TRISTAN
(starting up)
What? Isolde?

(He quickly composes himself and Brangaene
comes up to him and makes obeisance)

From my lady?
What has the faithful maid,
obedient to her,
courteously come
to tell me?

BRANGÄNE
Tristan, my lord,
to see you
is the wish of Isolde,
my lady.

TRISTAN
If the long voyage irks her,
it is near its end!
Before the sun sets
we shall reach land.
May whatever my lady commands
be faithfully carried out.

BRANGÄNE
Lord Tristan
is to go to her,
that is my lady's will.

TRISTAN
There where the green pastures
still appear blue to the eye,
my King is waiting
for my lady;
to escort her to him
I shall soon approach the radiant one:
to none other would I grant
this grace.

BRANGÄNE
My lord. Tristan,
listen well.
The lady
requires you to attend her,
and to proceed
to where she awaits you.

TRISTAN
On this spot
where I am standing
I serve her faithfully,
the most honourable lady;
were I to leave the helm
at this very hour,
how could I safely steer the craft
to King Mark's land?

BRANGÄNE
Tristan, my lord,
why do you mock me?
If the foolish maid
cannot make it clear,
then hear my lady's words!
Thus, she said, I should speak to you:
Let her command
teach the vainglorious one
to fear his mistress,
Isolde!

KURWENAL
(leaping up)
Can I give her her answer?

TRISTAN
(gently)
What would your answer be?

KURWENAL
Let her say this
to the lady Isolde!
He who Cornwall's crown
and England's succession
bestows upon the Irish girl,
he cannot be
in thrall to the maid,
he who gives her to his uncle.
A lord of the world,
Tristan the hero!
That's my call, that's what you'll say, though a
thousand Lady Isoldes should vent their rage upon me!

(As Tristan tries to subdue him
by gestures, and Brangaene indignantly
turns to leave, Kurwenal sings
after her with full voice
as she slowly moves away)

"Lord Morold went
off to sea
to exact tribute in Cornwall;
an island floats
in the desolate seas,
there he now lies buried!
But his head is hanging
in Ireland
as tribute paid
to England:
hail to our hero, Tristan,
he knows how to exact tribute!"

(Kurwenal, rebuked by Tristan, has climbed down below deck; Brangaene has returned to Isolde in dismay and closed the curtain behind her, while outside the whole crew can be heard)

CREW
"But his head is hanging
in Ireland
as tribute paid
by England:
hail to our hero, Tristan,
he knows how to exact tribute!"

SCENE THREE

(Isolde and Brangaene alone, all the curtains closed again. Isolde stands up with a gesture of hopeless rage. Brangaene falls at her feet)

BRANGÄNE
Ah! Alas!
To suffer this!

ISOLDE
(on the point of a fearful outburst,
quickly pulls herself together)

Now, what of Tristan?
I want to know exactly!

BRANGÄNE
Ah! do not ask!

ISOLDE
Tell me freely, without fear!

BRANGÄNE
With courtly expressions
he evaded my words.

ISOLDE
But when you warned him clearly?

BRANGÄNE
When I called him
here to you,
where he was standing,
he said,
he served you faithfully,
the most honourable lady;
were he to leave the helm
at this very hour,
how could he safely steer the craft
to King Mark's land?

ISOLDE
(bitter and hurt)
How could he safely steer the craft
to King Mark's land?

(harshly and violently)
To hand over to him the tribute
that he exacted from Ireland!

BRANGÄNE
At your own words,
when I repeated them to him,
his servant Kurwenal...

ISOLDE
I heard him,
not a word escaped me.
If you sensed my disgrace,
hear now what it meant for me.

As they mockingly sing
behind my back,
well might I make reply
about a boat
which, small and frail,
drifted along the irish coast.
In it a sick
and ailing man
lay miserably dying.
Isolde's crafts
became known to him;
with healing ointments
and soothing lotions,
the wound which tormented him
she faithfully nursed.
He who with sly cunning
called himself "Tantris"
Isolde soon recognised
as Tristan
since in his sword, as he lay there,
she perceived a notch
into which,
as she found with nimble fingers,
there fitted exactly a splinter
which once, in the head
of the Irish knight,
had been sent back to mock her.
Then a cry awoke
from the depths of my heart!
With the gleaming sword
I stood before him,
ready to averge on him, the presumptuous one,
Lord Morold's death.

From his bed,
he looked up -
not at the sword,
not at my hand -
he gazed into my eyes.
His wretchedness
tormented me!
The sword - I dropped it!
The wound that Morold smote,
I healed it so that he recovered
and returned home...
do not accuse me with such a look!

BRANGÄNE
How strange! Where were my eyes?
The guest that once
I helped to nurse?

ISOLDE
You have just heard his praises:
"Hey! Our Lord Tristan!"
He was that pathetic man.
With a thousand oaths he swore to me
eternal gratitude and loyalty.
Hear now how a hero
keeps his oath!
He whom, as Tantris,
I let go unidentified,
as Tristan
boldly soon returned;
on a proud ship,
from a lofty deck
he demanded the Irish successor
as a bride
for Cornwall's feeble king,
for Mark, his uncle.
If Morold were alive,
who would ever have dared
to bring such shame upon us?
For this vassal
prince of the Cornish
to suit for the crown of Ireland!
Ah, I am lost!
Yes, I it was
who, in secret, brought
the shame upon myself!
The avenging sword,
instead of wielding it,
I impotently let it fall!
Now I am in the vassal's bondage!

BRANGÄNE
When peace, reconciliation and amity
were sworn by all,
we hailed the happy day.
How could I have foreseen
that it would cause you such grief?
ISOLDE
Oh blind eyes!
Credulous heart!
Despairing silence,
feeble courage!
How differently
Tristan paraded
what I had kept concealed!
She who in silence
gave him his life,
from the enemy's fury
quietly hid him,
who silently lent
her sanctuary to save him,
both her and all that he abandoned!
Boasting of victory,
glorious and bold,
loud and clear
he pointed to me:
"There's a treasure,
my lord and uncle;
how about that for a wife?
This trim Irish girl
I'll bring back to you;
knowing well
the way,
with a wave I was off
to Ireland;
Isolde - she's yours!
What a splendid bit of adventure!"
Curse you, vile creature,
a curse upon your head!
Vengeance! Death!
Death for us both!

BRANGÄNE
(impetuously and tenderly
embracing Isolde)

O sweet one, beloved!
Dearest! Beautiful one!
Golden mistress!
Dear Isolde!
(She gradually draws Isolde
to the couch)

Listen to me! Come!
Sit here!
What madness!
What vain anger!
How can you be so confused
as not to see or hear clearly?
What Lord Tristan
ever owed you,
how better could he repay it
than with the most splendid of crowns?
Thus could he loyally serve
his noble uncle.
To you he gave the world's
most desirable prize -
his own inheritance,
nobly and in good faith;
he relinquished it at your feet
to hail you as Queen!

(Isolde turns aside)

And if he secured Mark
as a husband for you,
why did you scorn the choice?
Can you not see its value?
Of noble blood
and gentle disposition,
who can compare with the man
in power and glory?
He whom a bold hero
so faithfully serves,
who might not share his fortune
and live beside him as his wife?

ISOLDE
(gazing ahead wildly)
Unloved, always
seeing near me
that splendid man!
How could I bear the torment?

BRANGÄNE
What are you thinking of, wicked girl?
Unloved, always?

(She comes close,
reassuring and embracing Isolde)
Where is the man
who would not love you?
who could see Isolde
and not be blissfully consumed
in Isolde?
But he who chose you,
however cold he might be,
or if a spell
had turned him from you,
I would know
how to constrain him.
The power of love would constrain him

(secretively and confidentially
to Isolde)

Do you not know our
mother's craft?
Do you imagine that she,
who considers everything,
would have sent me away with you
without means of help into foregin land?

ISOLDE
(darkly)
My mother's advice
is good counsel;
gladly I recognise the worth of
her craft.
Vengeance for the treachery!
Easement for the heart's distress!
Fetch me that chest over there!

BRANGÄNE
What it contains will bring you relief.

(She fetches a small golden
chest, opens it
and shows its contents)

In this your mother arranged
the powerful magic draughts.
For pain and wounds
here is ointment;
for evil poisons
antidote
(She draws out a flask)

The finest draught
I keep here.

ISOLDE
You are wrong, I know better;
I placed a clear sign
upon it.

(She takes a flash and shows it)
This is the potion that I need!

BRANGÄNE
(starts back, horrified)
The death potion!
(Isolde has got up from the couch, and with growing terror hears the shouts of the crew)

CREW
(off)
Ho! hey! ha! hey!
Lower mast,
take in sail!
Ho! hey! ha! hey!

ISOLDE
That means a swift voyage.
Wretched that I am! Near to land!

SCENE FOUR

The previous characters and Kurwenal

(Kurwenal enters boisterously through the curtains)

KURWENAL
Up! Up, you ladies!
Lively and cheerful!
Make ready!
Come along, smartly now!

(more formally)

And to Lady Isolde
I am to say
from Tristan the hero,
my lord:
From the mast the festive flag
is fluttering merrily towards land;
in Mark's royal castle
it announces its approach.
He therefore requests
Lady Isolde to hurry
and to prepare for landing
so that he may escort her.

ISOLDE
(after at first shrinking back in fear
at the message, composes herself
and, with dignity)

Convey to Lord Tristan
my greetings,
and tell him what I say:
If I am to walk at his side
to stand before King Mark,
it would not be done
with due propriety and custom
unless I received restitution
in advance
for guilt still unatoned.
Let him then seek my grace.

(Kurwenal grimaces sourly.
Isolde continues, more forcefully)

Mark it well
and report it true!
I will not make ready
to accompany him ashore,
I shall not walk at his side
to stand before King Mark;
he must first seek
forgiveness
and forgetting,
according to propriety and custom,
for unatoned guilt.
Such my grace would grant him!

KURWENAL
You may be sure
I shall tell him that;
now wait to hear how he receives it!

(He returns quikly to Tristan. Isolde hurries to Brangaene and embraces her impetuously)

ISOLDE
Now farewell, Brangaene!
Bid the world farewell for me,
bid my mother and father farewell!

BRANGÄNE
What is this? What are you thinking of?
Do you intend to flee?
Whither am I to follow you?

ISOLDE
(quickly composes herself)
Did you nor hear me?
I shall stay here
and wait for Tristan.
Faithfully carry out
my orders,
the draught of reconciliation -
prepare it quickly;
you know, the one I showed you?

(She takes the flask from the chest)

BRANGÄNE
Which draught?

ISOLDE
This draught!
Pour it out
into the golden goblet;
it will hold it all.

BRANGÄNE
(in fear and trembling taking the flask)
Can I belive it?
ISOLDE
Be faithful to me!

BRANGÄNE
That draught - for whom?

ISOLDE
Let him who betrayed me...

BRANGÄNE
Tristan?

ISOLDE
...drink reconciliation!

BRANGÄNE
(falling at Isolde's feet)
Horror! Have pity on me, poor wretch!

ISOLDE
(violently)
You should pity me,
faithless maid!
Do you not know
my mother's craft?
Do you imagine that she,
who considers everything,
would have sent me away with you
without means of help into a foregin land?
For pain and wounds
she gave ointment,
for evil potions
antidote;
For sharpest pain,
for extreme anguish
she gave the death potion.
Let Death now thank her.

BRANGÄNE
(almost fainting)
Oh deepest woe!

ISOLDE
Will you obey me now?

BRANGÄNE
Oh utmost grief!

ISOLDE
Will you be faithful to me?

BRANGÄNE
That draught?

KURWENAL
(enters)
Lord Tristan!

(Brangaene rises, horrified and confused. Isolde tries, with great strain, to compose herself)

ISOLDE
(to Kurwenal)
Let Lord Tristan approach!

SCENE FIVE

Tristan. Isolde. Brangaene. Then Kurwenal, Saylors, Knights and Squires

(Kurwenal withdraws. Brangaene, almost fainting, moves upstage. Isolde, summoning up all her strength for the crisis, moves slowly and with great dignity towards the couch and, leaning against it, fixes her gaze on the entrance. - Tristan enters and waits respectfully at the entrance. - Isolde, terribly agitated, is lost in beholding him. - Long silence)

TRISTAN
Demand, my lady,
what you wish.

ISOLDE
Surely you knew
what I demanded
when the fear
of fulfilling it
kept you from my sight?

TRISTAN
Respect
held me in awe.

ISOLDE
You showed me
little enough respect;
with blatant mockery
you refused
to obey my command.

TRISTAN
Obedience alone
constrained me.

ISOLDE
I have little
to thank your master for;
does his service require
ill-manners
towards his bride?

TRISTAN
Manners teach,
where I come from,
that on a courtship voyage
the suitor
should stay apart from the bride.

ISOLDE
For what reason?

TRISTAN
Look to manners!

ISOLDE
Since you are so mannerly,
my lord Tristan,
let me remind you
of more manners;
to be reconcilied with an enemy
he must regard you as a friend.

TRISTAN
Which enemy?

ISOLDE
Ask your own fear!
A debt of blood
exists between us!

TRISTAN
It was atoned.

ISOLDE
Not between us!

TRISTAN
In an open field,
before all the people,
the peace was sworn.

ISOLDE
It was not there
that I hid Tantris,
and had Tristan in my power.
There he stood, glorious,
bold and strong;
but what he swore
I did not swear;
I had learned to keep silent.
When in my quiet chamber
he lay sick,
and I stood quietly
before him with the sword,
my lips were silent,
I held my hand -
but what once with my hands
and lips I praised
I swore to keep silent.
Now I will discharge my oath!

TRISTAN
What oath did you take, my lady?

ISOLDE
Vengeance for Morold!

TRISTAN
Does that concern you?

ISOLDE
Do you dare mock?
He was betrothed to me,
the bold Irish hero.
I had blessed his weapons,
for me he went into battle.
When he fell
my honour fell too.
With heavy heart
I took the oath, swearing
that if a man did not atone for his murder,
I, the maid, would venture to do so.

Sickly and feeble,
in my power,
why did I not strike you down then?
You know well why that was so.
I nursed his wounds
so that, restored to strength,
he would be slain in vengeance by that man
who had won Isolde from him.
But now you yourself
can speak your lot!
Since all men have bound themselves to him,
who now has to slay Tristan?

TRISTAN
(pale and gloomy)
If Morold meant so much to you,
now take the sword again
and wield it sure and strong
so that it does not fall from your hand.

(He proffers her his sword)

ISOLDE
What scant regard I should have
for your Lord;
what would King
Mark say
were I to slay
his finest vassal
who won for him crown and lands,
that most faithful man?
Do you value so lightly
what he owes you,
bringing the irish maid
to him as his bride?
Would he not reproach me
if I slew the suitor
who so faithfully delivered
into his hands the treaty's bond?
Put up your sword!
When I wielded it before,
when vengeance
tore at my breast,
when your measuring gaze
stole my likeness, to see
if I would suit King Mark
as a wife,
the sword - I let it sink.
Let us now drink reconciliation!

(She makes a sign to Brangaene. Brangaene shudders, wavers and hesitates. Isolde urges her on with more emphatic gestures. Brangaene turns to prepare the draught)

CREW
(from outside)
Ho! hey! ha! hey!
Upper mast,
take in sail!
Ho! hey! ha! hey!

TRISTAN
(starting out of gloomy broodings)
Where are we?

ISOLDE
Hard by our goal!
Tristan, do I win reconciliation?
What have you to say to me?

TRISTAN
(darkly)
The mistress of silence
bids me say nothing.
If I grasp what she concealed,
I shall conceal what she does not grasp.

ISOLDE
I can grasp your silence!
You are evading me.
Do you refuse to make atonement?

(New cries of sailors)

(At Isolde's emphatic gesture, Brangaene hands her the filled goblet)

ISOLDE
(going over with the goblet to Tristan,
who gazes coldly into her eyes)

Can you hear their cries?
We have arrived.
Before long
we still be standing

before King Mark.
When you escort me,
would it not be good
if you were to speak to him thus:
"My lord and uncle,
look upon her.
A more gentle wife
you would never have won.
Her betrothed
I once slew,
his head I sent home to her.
The wounds which
his arms inflicted
she tenderly healed.
My life lay
in her power;
the gentle maid
gave it to me,
and her land's
shame and disgrace
she gave me with it,
to be your consort.
Gracious thanks
for such sweet gifts
were awakened in me by a sweet
draught of reconciliation.
In it was contained her grace
which absolved me from all guilt."

CREW
(off)
Haul away!
Anchor away!

TRISTAN
(staring up wildly)
Anchor away!
Into the tide!
Sails and mast to the wind!

(He seizes the goblet from her)
Well I know
Ireland's queen
and the wondrous power
of her craft.
I used the ointment
that she offered.
I shall take the goblet
that I may be fully cleansed.
And witness too
the oath of reconciliation
which I take, in gratitude to you.
Tristan's honour,
utter loyalty!
Tristan's misery,
keenest defiance!
Heart's deceit,
wishful dreaming!
The only consolation
in eternal mourning.
Beneficent draught of forgetsulness,
I drain you unweaveringly!

(He takes the goblet and drinks)

ISOLDE
Treachery here too?
Half is mine!

(She snatches the goblet)

Traitor! I drink to you!

(She drinks. Then she throws the goblet aside. In the grip of terror, they gaze steadily into each other's eyes in utmost agitation, but unmoving. In their eyes deadly defiance gives way to the glow of love. They are seized with trembling. They clutch convulsively at their hearts and raise their hands to their heads. Then their eyes seek out one another, are cast down again in confusion, and meet again with growing desire)

ISOLDE
(her voice trembling)
Tristan!

TRISTAN
(overcome)
Isolde!

ISOLDE
(sinking on his breast)
Faithless darling!

TRISTAN
(ardently embracing her)
Blessed lady!

(They remain in silent embrace)
(In the distance trumpets are heard)

MEN'S VOICE
Hail! Hail King Mark!

BRANGÄNE
(looking away in confusion and terror,
has leaned over the rail,
now turns to see the couple
clasped in a loving embrace
and moves downstage,
wringing her hands
in despair)

Ah! Alas!
Inescapable
eternal misery
instead of an early death!
The deceiving effects
of foolish loyalty
now bear their miserable fruit.

(Tristan and Isolde start out of their embrace)

TRISTAN
(bewildered)
What was my dream
of Tristan's honour?

ISOLDE
What was my dream
of Isolde's disgrace?

TRISTAN
You lost to me?

ISOLDE
You rejecting me?

TRISTAN
Deceitful magic's
sly cunning!

ISOLDE
Foolish anger's
vain threats.

TRISTAN
Isolde!

ISOLDE
Tristan!

TRISTAN
Sweetest girl!

ISOLDE
Dearest man!

TOGETHER
How our hearts
are borne aloft!
How all our senses
pulsate with bliss!
Longing devotion's
burgeoning blossoms,
yearning love's
blessed glow!
My breast bursting
with exultant delight!
Isolde! Tristan!
Broken free of the world,
won for me!
You my only awareness,
utmost rapture of love!

(The curtains are pulled apart, the whole ship is crowded with knights and sailors waving joyfully over the side towards the shore which can be seen close by, with a high, rocky fortress. Tristan and Isolde remain lost in gazing at one another, unaware of what is happening arounf them)

BRANGÄNE
(to the ladies who, at her command,
have come up from below deck)

Quickly, the mantle here,
the royal raiment!

(rushing between Tristan and Isolde)

Hapless ones! Come!
Listen, don't you hear where we are?

(She places the royal mantle about Isolde,
who does not notice it)

ALL THE MEN
Hail! Hail! Hail!
Hail to King Mark!
Long live the King!

KURWENAL
(entering briskly)
Hail Tristan,
fortunate hero!
With a splendid retinue
there, on the boat,
Lord Mark is approaching.
Ah, how the journey delights him,
winning a bride.

TRISTAN
(bewildered, looking up)
Who is approaching?

KURWENAL
The King!

TRISTAN
Which King?

(Kurwenal points over the side)

ALL THE MEN
(waving their caps)
Hail! Hail King Mark!

(Tristan stares blankly at the shore)

ISOLDE
(confused)
What is it, Brangaene?
What are they calling out?

BRANGÄNE
Isolde, my lady,
Compose yourself, if only for today!

ISOLDE
Where am I? Am I alive?
Ah! What was that draught?

BRANGÄNE
(in despair)
The love potion.

ISOLDE
(stares at Tristan, horrified)
Tristan!

TRISTAN
Isolde!

ISOLDE
Must I live on?

(She falls on his breast, unconscious)

BRANGÄNE
(to the ladies)
Help our mistress!

TRISTAN
Oh spiteful bliss!
Oh happiness in thrall to deceit!

ALL THE MEN
(breaking into general rejoicing)
Cornwall! Hail!

(Trumpets from the shore)

(People have climbed aboard, others have put out the gangplank, and the general activity indicates the immediately awaited arrival of the King's train, as the curtain quickly falls)

ACT TWO

PRELUDE

SCENE ONE

Isolde. Brangaene.

(A garden with tall trees in front of Isolde's apartments with steps leading up to it at one side. A clear, pleasant summer's night. At the open door is placed a burning torch. Sounds of hunting. Brangaene, on the steps to the apartments, looks out after the hunting party as their sounds fade away into the distance. Isolde comes out of the apartments in wild agitation and comes up to her)

ISOLDE
Can you still hear them?
Thay are out of my hearing already.

BRANGÄNE
(listening)
They are still near;
I can hear them clearly.

ISOLDE
(listening)
Anxious fears
confuse your ear.
You are misled by the grove's
whisperings,
laughingly rustling in the wind.

BRANGÄNE
You are misled by your
impetuous desires
into hearing what you imagine.

(She listens)

I can hear the horns calling.

ISOLDE
(listening again)
The calling of horns
does not sound so sweet,
it is the stream's gently
murmuring waves
flowing along so gaily.
How could I hear that
if horns were still calling?
In the still of the night it
is just stream that laughs with me.
He who is waiting for me
in the silence of the night,
as if horns still sounded nearby,
do you want to keep him for me?

BRANGÄNE
He who is waiting for you -
oh, listen to my warning -
spies lie in wait for him at night!
Because you are so blinded
do you imagine that the sight
of the world has been dimmed for you too?
When, on board ship,
from Tristan's trembling hand
the pallid bride,
scarcely conscious,
was received by King Mark,
when everybody bemusedly watched
her wavering there,
the kingly King,
with gentle concern,
loudly bewailed the trials
of the voyage which you had undergone.
But there was one,
as I clearly perceived,
who looked only into Tristan's eyes.
With a threatening gaze
full of malevolent guile
he sought to find in his expression
whatever would serve his purpose.
Spitefully listening
I have often found him.
Of him who secretly sets snares for you both,
of Melot, be warned!

ISOLDE
Do you mean Lord Melot?
Oh, how mistaken you are!
Is he not Tristan's
dearest friend?
If my beloved cannot be with me,
then he is only in Melot's company.

BRANGÄNE
What makes me suspect him
makes him dear to you!
From Tristan to Mark
is Melot's path:
there he sows malignant seeds.
Those who decided today
on this night hunt,
so promptly and quickly planned,
have a nobler quarry
than you imagine
as the target of their huntsmen's cunning.

ISOLDE
For his friend's sake,
out of sympathy,
Melot his friend
managed this ruse.
Do you now scold this faithful friend?
Better than you
does he care for me;
to him he opens up
what you bar to me.
Oh, spare me the distress of further delay!
The signal, Brangaene!
Oh, give the signal!
Extinguish the light's
last glimmer!
That it may fall completely,
give Night its signal!
Already its silence has flowed
through the groves and the house,
already it fills the heart
with ecstatic terror!
Oh, extinguish the light now,
extinguish its dread rays!
Let my beloved come!

BRANGÄNE
Oh, leave the warning flame,
let it show you the danger!
Ah, alas!
How wretched I am!
The hapless potion!
That, unfaithful
just once, I
betrayed my mistress's will!
Had I obeyed, deaf and blind,
your work
would have been death!
But your disgrace,
your ignominious distress
are my work,
and I, the guilty one, must know it!

ISOLDE
Your work!
Oh, foolish maid!
Do you not know the Love Spirit,
not know her magic's power?
The Queen
of boldest courage,
Regent of the
world's course?
Love and Death
are subject to her,
she weaves them out of bliss and sorrow,
transmuting envy into love.
Death's work,
upon which I audaciously embarked,
the Love Spirit
wrested it from my power.
She took the girl destined for death
under her sway and
took her work
into her own hands.
However she performed it,
however she completes it,
wherever she may choose for me,
wherever she may lead me,
I became subject to her.
Now let me display my obedience!
BRANGÄNE
And if Love's
spiteful draught
must extinguish the light of reason,
if you cannot see
when I warn you,
then now, this once,
hear my plea!
The gleaming signal of danger,
oh, not now, do not
extinguish the torch now!

ISOLDE
She kindled the glow
in my breast,
she makes
my heart burn,
like Day, she laughs
in my soul.
The will of the Love Spirit is -
let it be night,
that brightly she may shine forth,

(She hurries to the torch)

where she shuns your light!

(She takes the torch from the doorway)

To the tower with you!
Keep careful watch!
This light,
were it the light of my life,
laughing,
I do not hesitate to extinguish it.

(She throws the torch to the ground
where it gradually dies out)

(Brangaene turns away in dismay to climb an outside stairway to the tower, where she gradually disappears from sight)

(Isolde listens and looks, timidly at first, along an avenue of trees. Moved by a growing desire she approaches the trees and looks more carefully. She waves with a kerchief, a little at first, then, with passionate impatience, more and more quickly)

(A gesture of sudden delight proclaims that she has noticed her beloved in the distance. She stands on tip-toe, and, in order to see further, hurries back to the steps, from the top of which she waves to the approaching figure)

SCENE TWO

Tristan and Isolde

TRISTAN
(rushes in)
Isolde! Beloved!

ISOLDE
(leaping towards him)
Tristan! Beloved!

(In a passionate embrace they move downstage)

ISOLDE
Are you mine?

TRISTAN
With me once more?

ISOLDE
Dare I hold you?

TRISTAN
Can I belive it?

ISOLDE
At last! At last!

TRISTAN
On my breast!

ISOLDE
Is it really you I feel?

TRISTAN
Is it you I see?

ISOLDE
These your eyes?

TRISTAN
This your mouth?

ISOLDE
Here your hand?

TRISTAN
Here your heart?

ISOLDE
Is it I? Is it you?
You, clasped in my arms?

TRISTAN
Is it I? Is it you?
No illusion?

TOGETHER
Not a dream?
O heart's rapture,
o sweet, most sublime,
boldest, loveliest,
most blessed joy!

TRISTAN
Without equal!

ISOLDE
Overflowing!

TRISTAN
Replete with bliss!

ISOLDE
Eternal!

TRISTAN
Eternal!

ISOLDE
Never dreamt of!
Never yet known!

TRISTAN
Boundlessly
exalted and sublime!

ISOLDE
Joyous exulting!

TRISTAN
Blisful delight!

ISOLDE
Heaven-high soaring
beyond the world!
My Tristan mine!
Mine and yours!
Ever, ever one!

TRISTAN
Heaven-high soaring
beyond the world!
My Isolde mine!
Mine and yours!
Ever, ever one!

ISOLDE
For how long away!
Away for so long!

TRISTAN
How far yet so near!
So near yet how far!

ISOLDE
O enemy of friends,
evil distance!
Drawn-out time's
lingering expanse!

TRISTAN
O distance and nearness,
sternly parted!
Sweet nearness!
Desolate distance!

ISOLDE
You in darkness,
I in light!

TRISTAN
The light! The light!
Oh, this light,
how long before it was extinguished!
The sun set,
Day ran its course
but it would not stifle
its spite:
lighting its dread signal
it places it
at the loved one's door
so that I might not go to her.

ISOLDE
But the loved one's hand
extinguished the light;
what the maid would not risk
I did not fear:
under the power and protection of the Love-Spirit
I bade defiance to Day!

TRISTAN
Day! For Day,
for spiteful Day,
the most bitter foe,
hatred and grievance!
Just as you extinguished the light,
would that I could
extinguish the light of insolent Day
to avenge the pangs of love!
Is there any distress,
is there any anguish
which it does not revive
with its beams?
Even in Night's
darkling glory
my beloved harbours it in her house,
letting its threatening beams fall towards me.

ISOLDE
Is your beloved keeps it
in her own house,
so did my love once
defiantly foster it
in his heart,
bright and devious:
Tristan, he that betrayed me!
Was it not Day
that made him false
when he came to Ireland
as a suitor
to court me for King Mark,
to dedicate loyalty to Death?

TRISTAN
Day! Day!
Which shimmered round about you,
to there where she
seemed like the sun
in highest honour's
radiant glow,
Isolde withdrew from me!
That which so
delighted my eye
made my heart sink
to the depths of the earth:
in the bright light of Day
how could Isolde be mine?

ISOLDE
Was she not yours,
she that chose you?
What lies did evil Day
tell you
that you betrayed your dearest,
she that was destined to be yours?

TRISTAN
In the grip of madness I could not but
yeld my heart
to that which shimmered round about you
in majestic splendour,
the glitter of honour and
the power of renown.
Day's bright orb
of worldly honour,
shining upon me
with the brightest
radiant glow,
penetrated
my head
with its beams
of vain bliss
and reached
the deepest recesses
of my heart.
What lay there
darkly concealed in chaste night,
what I dimly perceived,
not knowing, not imagining;
a form, which my eyes
could not believe they saw,
caught in the light of Day,
lay there gleaming before me.
Before the whole throng
I praised in clear tones
what seemed to me
so glorious and sublime;
before all the people
I extolled aloud
the loveliest
royal bride on earth.
I bade defiance to
the envy which
Day awakened in me,
to the zeal which
threatened my happiness,
to the jealousy which began to make
honour and fame a burden to me,
and firmly resolved
to uphold honour and glory,
to go to Ireland.

ISOLDE
O vain thrall of Day!
Deceived by that which
deceived you,
how I, loving you,
suffered on your account;
caught in Day's
false glitter,
in the snare
of its cunning,
in the depths of my heart,
where burning love
encompassed him,
I hated him bitterly.
Ah, what piercing pain
in the recesses of my heart!
How hard he whom I secretly harboured there
must have thought me
when, in the light of Day
my faithfully cherished one
vanished to loving eyes
and stood before me only as a foe!
From the light of Day
which made you appear to me
a traitor
I wished to flee
into Night,
to take you with me,
where my heart would bid me
end all deception,
where the vain premonition
of treachery might be dispelled,
there to pledge to you
eternal love,
to consecrate you to Death
in company with myself.

TRISTAN
When I recognised
sweet death
offered to me
at your hand;
when a bold and
clear presentiment
showed me what
expiation demanded;
there dawned gently
in my heart
the lofty power of Night;
my Day was then accomplished.

ISOLDE
Alas, you were confused
by the deceiving potion
so that once again
Night eluded you:
as you faced only death,
it restored you to Day!

TRISTAN
Hail to the potion!
Hail to the draught!
Hail to its magic's
sublime power!
Through Death's portals
wide and open
it flowed towards me
opening up
the wondrous realm of Night
where I had only been in dreams.
From the image in my heart's
sheltering cell
it repelled day's
deceiving beams,
so that in darkness my eyes
might serve to see it clearly.

ISOLDE
Yet banished Day
avenged itself;
with yours sins
it took counsel;
what darkling Night
showed you
you had to surrender
to the regal power
of the Day-star,
to live alone,
gleaming there
in solitary splendour.
How could I bear it?
How can I endure it now?

TRISTAN
Oh, now we were
dedicated to Night!
Spiteful Day
with ready envy
could part us with its tricks
but no longer mislead us with guile.
Its vain glory,
its flaunting display
are mocked by those to whom Night
has granted sight.
The fleeting flashes
of its flickering light
no longer dazzle us.
Before him who has seen with love death's night,
before him to whom she confided
her dark secret,
are scattered
the lies, the renown
and honour of Day,
power and advantage
shining and glorious,
as the paltry dust
caught in the sunbeam!
Amid the vain fancy of Day
he still harbours one desire -
the yearning
for sacred Night
where, all-eternal,
true alone,
love's bliss smiles on him!

 

TOGETHER
Descend,
O Night of love,
grant oblivion
that I may live;
take me up
into your bosom,
release me from
the world!

TRISTAN
Extinguished now
the last glimmers;

ISOLDE
what we thought,
what we imagined;

TRISTAN
all thought

ISOLDE
all remembering,

TOGETHER
the glorious presentiment
of sacred twilight
extinguishes imagined terrors,
world-redeeming.

ISOLDE
The sun concealed
itself in our bosom,
the stars of bliss
gleam, laughing,

TRISTAN
softly entwined
in your magic,
sweetly dissolved
before your eyes;

ISOLDE
heart on your heart,
mouth on mouth;

TRISTAN
the single bond
of a single breath;

TOGETHER
my glance is deflected,
dazzled with bliss,
the world palses
with its blinding radiance:

ISOLDE
lit by Day's
guileful deception,

TRISTAN
standing firm against
deceitful delusion,

TOGETHER
then am I
myself the world;
floating in sublime bliss,
life of love most sacred,
the sweetly conscious
undeluded wish
never again to waken.

THE VOICE OF BRANGÄNE
(from the tower)
You upon whom
love's dream smiles,
take heed of
the voice of one
keeping solitary
watch at night,
foreseeing evil
for the sleepers,
anxiously urging
you to waken.
Beware!
Beware!
Night soon melts away.

ISOLDE
(softly)
Listen, beloved!

TRISTAN
(softly)
Let me die!

ISOLDE
(gradually raising her head a little)
Jealous watch!

TRISTAN
(still reclining)
Never waken!

ISOLDE
Must Day then
waken Tristan?

TRISTAN
(raising his head a little)
Let Day
give way before death!

ISOLDE
Should Day
and Death
both reach
our love?

TRISTAN
(raising himself up more)
Our love?
Tristan's love?
Yours and mine,
Isolde's love?
What strokes of death
could ever make it yeld?
If mighty Death
stood before me
threatening
the very life in my body
which I would so gladly leave
for love,
how could it
reach love itself?
Were I to give my life to that
for which I would so gladly die,
how could love
die with me,
the ever-living
end with me?
And if his love were never to die
how could Tristan die
of his love?

ISOLDE
But our love,
is it not Tristan
and Isolde?
This sweet little word: and,
would death not destroy
the bonds of love
which it entwines
if Tristan were to die?

TRISTAN
What could die
but that which troubles us,
preventing Tristan
from ever loving Isolde,
forever loving only her?

ISOLDE
Yet this little word: and,
were it destroyed,
how else but together
with Isolde's own life
would death be given to Tristan?

(Tristan with a meaningful gesture, gently draws Isolde to him)

TRISTAN
Thus might we die,
that together,
ever one,
without end,
never waking,
never fearing,
namelessly
enveloped in love,
given up to each other,
to live only for love!

ISOLDE
(as if in reflective rapture,
looking up at him)
Thus would we die,
that together -

TRISTAN
ever one,
without end -

ISOLDE
never waking -

TRISTAN
never fearing -

TOGETHER
namelessly
enveloped in love,
given up to ourselves
to live only for love!

THE VOICE OF BRANGÄNE
(as before)
Beware!
Beware!
Night soon gives way to Day.

TRISTAN
(smiling down at Isolde)
Shall I listen?

ISOLDE
(dreamily looking up at Tristan)
Let me die!

TRISTAN
Must I waken?

ISOLDE
Never waken!

TRISTAN
Shall Day
still waken Tristan?

ISOLDE
Let Day
give way to Death!

TRISTAN
Have we Day's menaces
thus defied?

ISOLDE
(in growing rapture)
Ever to flee its guile.

TRISTAN
Did its dawning
never affright us?

ISOLDE
(raising herself up
with a grand gesture)

May our Night endure for ever!

TOGETHER
O eternal Night,
sweet Night!
Gloriously sublime
Night of love!
Those whom you have embraced,
upon whom you have smiled,
how could they ever waken
without fear?
Now banish dread,
sweet death,
yearned for, longed for
death-in-love!
In your arms,
consecrated to you,
sacred elemental quickening force,
free from the peril of waking!
How to grasp it,
how to leave it,
this bliss
far from the sun's,
far from Day's
parting sorrows!
Free from delusion
gentle yearning,
free from fearing
sweet longing.
Free from sighing
sublime expiring.
Free from languishing
enclosed in sweet darkness.
No evasion
no parting,
just we alone,
ever home,
in unmeasured realms
of ecstatic dreams.

TRISTAN
Tristan you,
I Isolde,
no longer Tristan.

ISOLDE
You Isolde,
Tristan I,
no longer Isolde!

TOGETHER
Un-named,
free from parting,
new perception,
new enkindling;
ever endless
self-knowing;
warmly glowing heart,
love's utmost joy!

(They remain in a rapturous embrace)

SCENE THREE

The previous characters. Kurwenal, Brangaene, Mark, Melot and Courtiers.

(Brangaene emits a shrill cry. Kurwenal rushes in with unsheathed sword)

KURWENAL
Save yourself, Tristan!

(Horrified, he casts a glance offstage. Mark, Melot and courtiers in hunting dress come rapidly from the avenue of trees and stop in horror at the sight of the lovers. Brangaene climbs down from the tower and runs to Isolde. Isolde, involuntarily seized by a sense of shame, leans back, her face turned aside, on the flowery bank. Tristan, also in spite of himself, raises his cloak on his arm so that it conceals Isolde from the sight of those just arrived. He remains in this position for a long period, unmoving, his cold gaze fixed on the men who, in various attitudes, fasten their eyes on him. Dawn)

TRISTAN
(after a long silence)
Barren Day
for the last time!

MELOT
(to Mark)
Now tell me, my lord,
was I right to accuse him?
To give you my pledge
with my head as the bond?
I have shown him to you
in the very act;
your name and honour
I have loyally
preserved from disgrace.

MARK
(in a state of profound shock,
in a trembling voice)
Have you indeed?
Is that what you think?
Look at him there,
the most faithful of the loyal.
Cast your eyes upon him,
the dearest of friends.
His loyalty's
freest deed
pierced my heart
with its hostile treachery!
If Tristan betrayed me,
am I to hope
that what his treachery
has cost me
should by Melot's counsel
honestly be restored to me?

TRISTAN
(convulsively)
Spirits of Day!
Fantastic dream!
Deceitful and desolate!
Fade away! Give way!

MARK
(deeply affected)
This to me?
This, Tristan, to me?
Whither has loyalty fled
now that Tristan has betrayed me?
What price now honour
and honesty,
now that the champion of all honour,
Tristan, has lost it?
As Tristan appointed himself
its emblem,
where has virtue
flown to,
fleeing from my friend, from
Tristan, who has betrayed me?

(Tristan slowly lowers
his gaze; while Mark continues
there can be read in his
expression growing sadness)

Why did you serve me
for so long?
Why the reputation of honour,
the power and greatness
which you won for King Mark?
Did the honour and renown,
greatness and power,
the services
beyond number,
have to be repaid by Mark's dishonour?
Did you value so lightly
his gratitude
which gave you as your very own inheritance
that which you had won for him,
his renown and his Kingdom?
When, childless,
his wife died,
he loved you so much
that never again
did Mark intend to wed.
When all the people
from court and country
thronged to him,
begging and imploring him
to give the country a queen
and to take for himself a wife;
when you yourself
swore to your uncle
that you would carry out
the wishes of the court
and the will of the country, then,
against the wishes of court and country,
in opposition even to you,
with circumspection and kindness
he declined
until you, Tristan, threatened
to exile yourself for ever
from court and country
if you yourself
were not dispatched
to win a bride for the King.
And so he let it be.
This glorious woman
that your courage won for me,
who could behold her,
who could know her,
who could proudly
call her his own
and not think himself blessed?
She, whom I could never
dare approach,
she for whom I
foreswore my desires
in bashful reverence,
so splendid,
so lovely, so sublime,
who could not but
refresh my soul,
despite enemies and dangers
this royal bride
you presented to me.
Now, since by such
a possession you rendered
my heart more open to pain than before,
there, where I was rendered
soft, sensitive and exposed
was I stricken
without hope
that I might ever be healed.
Why so sorely,
wretched man,
did you wound me there now?
There, with the weapon
of tormenting poison,
searing and maiming
my senses and my mind
so that my fidelity
to my friend is stifled,
my open heart
filled with suspicion,
so that now, secretly
and in the dead of night
I creep up on you, my friend, eavesdropping,
and see my honour ended?
No heaven will redeem it for me -
why this hell for me?
No misery will atone for it -
why this disgrace?
The uncharted depths
of its mysterious causes,
who will make them known to the world?

TRISTAN
(raising his eyes to King Mark in sympathy)
O King,
I cannot tell you that;
what you would ask
you can never know.

(He turns to Isolde
who looks up at him longingly)

Wherever Tristan now goes
will you, Isolde, follow him?
To that land of which Tristan spoke,
where the sun's light does not shine;
it is the dark
land of Night
out of which my mother
sent me
when he, whom she bore
on her deathbed,
left her in death
to reach the light.
From that which, when she bore me,
was her fortress of love,
the wondrous realm of Night,
I then awoke.
That is what Tristan offers you,
thither he will precede you.
Whether she will follow him
in grace and faith,
let Isolde now tell him.

ISOLDE
When for a foreign land
her beloved once won her,
that ungracious man
Isolde had to follow
faithfully and graciously.
Now you are returning to your own estates
to show me your inheritance;
how could I flee that land
that spans the whole world?
Wherever Tristan's home may be,
there let Isolde go,
there let her follow him
in grace and faith,
so now show Isolde the way!

(Tristan bends over her and kisses her gently on the forehead. - Enter Melot in a rage)

MELOT
(drawing his sword)
Traitor! Ha!
To vengeance, King!
Will you suffer this shame?

(Tristan draws his sword and turns swiftly)

TRISTAN
Who dares his life against mine?

(He fixes his gaze on Melot)

This was my friend,
exalted and dear was his devotion to me;
for my honour and reputation
none was more concerned than he.
To impetuousness
he drove my heart;
he led the crowd
that urged me
to add to my honour and renown
and to give you to the King as bride!
The sight of you, Isolde,
blinded him too.
Out of jealousy I was betrayed
by my friend
to the King, whom I had betrayed.

(He strides up to Melot)

Defend yourself, Melot!

(As Melot raises his sword towards him, Tristan lowers his and falls wounded into Kurwenal's arms. Isolde falls upon his breast. Mark holds Melot back. - Curtain)

ACT THREE

SCENE ONE

The Shepherd. Kurwenal. Tristan.

(Castle garden. At one side a tall castle building, at the other a low parapet with a look-out post; upstage the castle gate. The location can be seen as being a rock height; through openings the sea and the distant horizon can be seen. The whole scene conveys an impression of being deserted, ill-tended, here and there in poor repair and overgrown. Downstage, inside the wall, Tristan is lying in the shade of a tall lime-tree, asleep on a couch, laid out as if lifeless.
At his head sits Kurwenal, bent over him in anguish and carefully listening to his breathing. As the curtain goes up there can be heard from outside the gate a shepherd playing a sad, yearning tune on a reed-pipe. At length the shepherd appears over the parapet and looks in with sympathetic interest)

SHEPHERD
(softly)
Kurwenal, hey!
Listen, Kurwenal!
Hear, my friend!

(Kurwenal partly turns
his head towards him)

Is he still not awake?

KURWENAL
(sadly shaking his head)
Were he to waken
it would only be
to depart for ever,
if she, the healer,
does not first appear,
the only one who can succour us.
Have you seen nothing yet?
Still no ship out at sea?

SHEPHERD
A different tune
would you hear then,
as merry as I could make it.
Now, tell me truly,
my old friend,
what ails our lord?

KURWENAL
Do not ask.
You can never know.
Keep a sharp look-out,
and if you see a ship
play merrily and clearly!

(The shepherd turns and gazes out to sea, his hand shielding his eyes)

SHEPHERD
Desolate and void the sea!

(He puts his reed to his lips
and departs, playing)

TRISTAN
(motionless, dully)
That old tune?
Why does it waken me?

(he opens his eyes and
turns his head a little)

Where am I?

KURWENAL
(starts, surprised)
Ha! That voice!
His voice!
Tristan! My lord!
My hero! My tristan!

TRISTAN
(with difficulty)
Who is calling me?

KURWENAL
At last! At last!
Life, oh life,
sweet life,
restored to my Tristan!

TRISTAN
(raising himself up a little from
the couch, in a flat tone)
Kurwenal? You?
Where have I been?
Where am I?

KURWENAL
Where are you?
In peace, safe and free,
in Kareol, my lord!
Do you not recognise the castle
of your fathers?

TRISTAN
Of my fathers?

KURWENAL
Just look about you!

TRISTAN
What did I hear?

KURWENAL
The shepherd's tune
it was that you heard once more;
down on the hillside
he is keeping watch over your flocks.

TRISTAN
My flocks?

KURWENAL
My lord, just as I say!
Yours is the house,
court and castle!
The people, loyal
to their dear lord,
as well as they could manage,
have looked after the house and court
which once my lord,
as their very own heritage,
granted to the people
when he left it all behind
to travel to a foregin land.

TRISTAN
To which land?

KURWENAL
Well now! To Cornwall;
bravely and gaily,
what glory,
fortune and honour
Tristan my hero won for himself there!

TRISTAN
Am I in Cornwall?

KURWENAL
Of course not, in Kareol!

TRISTAN
How did I get here?

KURWENAL
Indeed! How did you get here?
You didn't come on horseback;
a boat brought you here.
But to the ship
here, on my shoulders,
I carried you - they are broad:
they carried you there to the shore.
Now you are home, at home in your own country;
really at home
in your mother country;
amidst your own meadows and delights,
in the light of the old sun
where from death and from your wounds
you will blessedly be healed.

(He embraces Tristan)

TRISTAN
(after a brief silence)
Is that what you think?
I know differently
but I am not able to tell you.
Where I awoke,
there I was not,
but where I was
I cannot tell you.
I did not see the sun,
nor did I see land and people;
but what I did see
I cannot tell you.
I was
where I had been before I was
and where I am destined to go,
in the wide realm
of the Night of the world.
But one certain knowledge
is ours there:
divine, eternal
utter oblivion.
How did I cease to perceive it?
Yearning remembrance
did I call you,
driving me on anew
towards the light of Day.
The one thing that I remembered,
a warm and ardent love
drives me from the terror of Death's bliss
to see the Light,
which, deceiving, bright and golden,
still shines about you, Isolde!

(Kurwenal, in the grip of terror,
hides his face. Tristan
gradually raises himself up)

Isolde still
in the realm of the Sun!
In the shimmer of Day
still, Isolde!
What longing!
What fearing!
To see her,
what desire!
The crash that I heard
behind me
was Death's
door closing:
now once more it stands
wide open,
the sun's beams
have burst it open;
with wide open eyes
I had to emerge from Night
to seek her,
to see her;
to find her,
in her alone
to expire,
to vanish
has it been granted to Tristan.
Alas, there now rise up
within me,
pale and fearful,
Day's wild urgings;
baleful and deceiving
its orb
rouses my mind
to deceit and folly!
Accursed Day
with your light!
Will you for ever
be witness to my anguish?
Will it burn for ever,
this Light,
which even at night
kept me from her?
Ah, Isolde,
sweet beauty!
When at last,
when, oh when
will you extinguish the spark,
that I may know my fortune?
The light - when will it be extinguished?

(He sinks back, exhausted)

When will Night come to the house?
KURWENAL
(deeply shocked, pulling himself
out of his depressed state)

She whom I once defied
out of loyalty to you,
with you to her
I must now long to go.
Belive what I say:
you shall see her
here this very day;
that consolation I can give you -
if she is still alive herself.

TRISTAN
(very faintly)
Still the light is not extinguished,
still Night does not come to the house!
Isolde still lives and keeps watch;
she called me out of the Night.

KURWENAL
If she lives then,
let hope smile upon you!
Even if you think Kurwenal is foolish,
today you will not scold him.
As if dead you lay there
since that day
when Melot, the villain,
dealt you a wound.
That evil wound,
how to heal it?
To me, simple that I am,
it rather seems that
she who once before eased for you
the torment of Morold's wound,
she could easily heal the torment
of Melot's sword.
The best physician [Isolde]
I soon discovered:
to Cornwall I have
sent word;
a faithful man
is bringing Isolde here
across the sea.

TRISTAN
(beside himself)
Isolde is coming!
Isolde approaches!
(He struggles for the words)
Oh faith! Bold,
sweet faith!

(He embraces Kurwenal)

My Kurwenal,
dearest friend!
Unshakeably faithful,
how is Tristan to thank you?
My shield and my guard
in battle and strife,
in merrymaking and sorrow
always by my side.
He that I hated,
you hated too.
Him I worshipped,
you worshipped too.
To the good King Mark,
when I served him well,
you were truer than Gold!
When I had to betray
that noble lord,
how glad you were to betray him too!
ver your own self,
mine alone,
you suffer with me
when I suffer:
only what I suffer
you cannot suffer!
This fearful longing
that sears me;
this languishing flame
that consumes me;
were I to give you its name,
could you know it,
you would not tarry here,
you would hurry away to keep watch -
with all your senses
longing to get away
to keep careful watch
for their billowing sails
before the wind
where, aflame with the urgings of love,
to find me,
Isolde is sailing towards me.
It approaches! It approaches,
speedy and brave!
It waves, it waves,
the flag on the mast.
The ship! The ship!
There it goes past the reef!
Can't you see it?
(vehemently)
Kurwenal, can't you see it?

(As Kurwenal hesitates, so as not to leave Tristan, and the latter looks at him, silent and tense, there sounds out, as before, at first near by and then in the distance the plaintive tune of the shepherd)

KURWENAL
(disheartened)
Still no ship in sight!

TRISTAN
(has been listening with failing enthusiasm,
now with growing melancholy)

Must I understand you thus,
you ancient, solemn tune
with your plaintive tones?
Through the evening air
it came, fearfully,
as once it brought news to the child
of his father's death.
Through the grey light of morning,
ever more fearful,
as the son
became aware of his mother's lot.
As he begat me and died,
so, dying, she bore me.
That ancient tune
of anxious yearning
sounded its lament
to them too,
asking me then,
and asking me now,
for what fate
was I then born?
For what fate?
The ancient tune
tells me once more:
to yearn - and to die!
No! Ah, no!
That is not it!
Yearning! Yearning!
While dying to yearn,
but not to die of yearning!
Never dying,
yearning, calling out
for the peace of death
to the far-away physician.
Dying I lay
in the boat, silent,
the wound's poison
near my heart:
in plaintive yearning
the tune sounded forth;
the wind blew the sail
towards Ireland's child.
The wound which
she closed,
with the sword
she opened up again;
but then, the sword,
she lowered it;
the poison draught
she gave me to drink;
as I hoped fully
to be healed by it,
then was the most searing
magic unleashed:
that I might never die
but inherit eternal torment!
The draught! The draught!
The fearful draught!
From my heart to my brain
it forced its furious way!
No healing,
no sweet death
can ever release me
from yearning's distress;
never, ah never
shall I find peace:
Night casts me out
into Day,
ever to feed my sorrows
in the sight of the sun.
Oh, this sun's
searing rays,
how my head burns
from its scorching torture!
For the burning longing
of this heat
ah, no shade's
dark concealment!
For the burning longing's
terrible torment
what ointment could
bring me ease?
The fearful draught
that brings me anguish,
I, I myself,
I prepared it!
From my father's distress
and mother's anguish,
from tears of love
everlasting,
from laughing and weeping,
happiness and hurts,
I found
the poisonous draught!
What I had prepared
flowed towards me;
devouring it blissfully
I enjoyed it -
be accursed, fearful draught!
Cursed be he that prepared you!
(He falls back unconscious)

KURWENAL
(vainly trying to calm Tristan,
cries out in horror)

My Lord! Tristan!
Dreadful Magic!
Love's deception!
Passion's urgings!
The world's loveliest delusion,
what has happened to you?
Here he lies,
the splendid man,
loved and adored as no other.
See now what thanks
Love has won for him,
the thanks that love always wins!

(with a catch in his voice)

Are you dead?
Are you still alive?
Has the curse borne you away?

(He listens for his breath)

O joy! No!
He is moving, he is alive!
How gently he moves his lips!

TRISTAN
(slowly coming to his senses)
The ship! Can't you see it yet?
KURWENAL
The ship? Of course,
it will be here today!
It can't be far off now.

TRISTAN
And on it Isolde,
how she is waving,
how sweetly she is drinking
reconciliation to me.
Can you see her?
Can't you see her yet,

as she sweetly,
bravely and gently
wanders across
the watery plains?
On soft waves
of blissful flowers
she gently comes
into land.
She smiles at me,
giving comfort and sweet peace,
she brings me
my last refreshment.
Ah, Isolde! Isolde!
How lovely you are!
And Kurwenal, tell me,
do you not see her?
Go and keep watch,
foolish wretch!
What I can see so bright and clear,
do not let it escape you!
Can you not hear me?
Quickly, to the lookout!
Quickly, keep watch!
Are you still there?
The ship? The ship?
Isolde's ship?
You must see it!
Must see it!
The ship! Can't you see it yet?

(While Kurwenal, hesitating, restrains Tristan, the shepherd sounds his pipe. Kurwenal springs up joyfully)

KURWENAL
Oh, happiness! Joy!

(He leaps to the lookout post
and gazes out to sea)

Ah! The ship!
I can see it approaching from the north!

TRISTAN
(with growing excitement)
Didn't I know it?
Didn't I say
that she was still alive,
sustaining life in me?
As the only thing
it holds for me,
how could Isolde
have departed the world?

KURWENAL
(calling from the lookout post, joyfully)
Ahoy! Ahoy!
How bravely it sails!
How the sails are filled!
How it streaks along, how it flies!

TRISTAN
The flag? The flag?

KURWENAL
The festive flag
at the masthead merry and bright!

TRISTAN
(raising himself up on his cot)
Ah! The flag of joy!
In the clear light of Day,
to me, Isolde!
Isolde, to me!
Can you see Isolde herself?

KURWENAL
The ship has disappeared
behind the rocks.

TRISTAN
Behind the reef?
Is it in danger?
There, in the turbulent current,
ships are wrecked.
Who is at the helm?

KURWENAL
The safest of seamen.

TRISTAN
Might he betray us,
could he be one of Melot's men?

KURWENAL
Trust in him as in me!

TRISTAN
You too a traitor!
Wretched man!
Can you see her yet?

KURWENAL
Not yet.

TRISTAN
Lost!

KURWENAL
(joyously)
Ahoy! Ahoy!
Through! Through!
Safely through!

TRISTAN
(joyously)
Kurwenal! Ahoy! Ahoy!
most faithful of friends!
All my goods and possessions
I bequeath this day!

KURWENAL
They are approaching at speed.

TRISTAN
Can you see them at last?
Can you see Isolde?

KURWENAL
There she is! She is waving!

TRISTAN
Oh blessed woman!

KURWENAL
The ship is in harbour!
Isolde - ah,
with a single bound
she is leaping ashore!

TRISTAN
Come down from the lookout post,
idle gazer!
Down! Down!
to the beach!
Help her! Help my lady!

KURWENAL
I'll carry her up here:
trust in my arms!
But you, Tristan,
promise to stay on your couch.
(Kurwenal hurries away)

SCENE TWO

Tristan. Isolde. Kurwenal.

TRISTAN
(in great excitement,
straining on his couch)

Oh this sun!
Ah! This Day!
Ah, this joy's
sunniest day!
Coursing blood,
rejoicing spirit!
Bliss beyond bounds,
joyful delirium!
Confined to my bed,
how can I bear it!
Up then and onwards
to where hearts are beating!
Tristan the hero,
rejoicing in his strength
has snatched himself back
from death.

(He raises himself up)

With bleeding wound
I once battled with Morold,
with bleeding wound
I now pursue Isolde!

(He tears the dressing
from his wound)

Ah, my blood!
Cheerily flow, my blood!

(He leaps from his bed
and staggers forward)

She who my wound
will finally heal,
like a hero approaches,
she approaches, my salvation!
Let the world perish
before my rejoicing haste!

(He staggers to the centre of the stage)

ISOLDE
(from outside)
Tristan! Beloved!

TRISTAN
(in extreme agitation)
What? Is it the light I hear?
The torch, ah!
The torch is extinguished!
To her! To her!

(Isolde enters breathlessly. Tristan, hardly conscious, totters towards her. They meet in the centre of the stage. She takes him in her arms. Tristan sinks slowly to the ground in her arms)

ISOLDE
Tristan! Ha!

TRISTAN
(dying, looks up at her)
Isolde!

(He dies)

ISOLDE
Ah! It is I! It is I!
sweetest beloved!
Up, just once more,
listen to my call!
Isolde is calling:
Isolde has come
faithfully to die with Tristan.
Will you not answer me?
Just for one hour,
just for one hour
stay awake for me!
For so many anxious days
she kept watch, longing
to watch with you
for an hour.
Will Tristan
deny Isolde
this single,
eternally brief,
final worldly joy?
The wound? Where is it?
Let me heal it!
Let us in untroubled bliss
share the Night!
Not from that wound,
do not die from that wound.
Unite us both,
extinguish the light of life!
Dimmed your eyes!
Silent your heart!
Not a breath's
gentle wafting!
Must she now in misery
stand before you,
she who joyously, to marry you,
bravely crossed the sea?
Too late!
Spiteful man!
Will you punish me thus
with this most harsh of sentences?
No consideration
of my sorrow's debt?
May I not utter
my lament to you?
Just once, ah!
just once more!
Tristan! Ah!
Listen! He is waking!
Beloved!

(She collapses unconscious
over the body)

SCENE THREE

The previous characters. The Shepherd. The Steersman. Melot. Brangaene. Mark. Knights and Squires.

(Kurwenal has just come in behind Isolde; speechless and deeply shocked he has witnessed the scene and stared at Tristan, motionless. From below can be heard a dull murmuring and clatter of weapons. The shepherd comes climbing over the wall)

SHEPHERD
(turning quickly and
quietly to Kurwenal)
Kurwenal! Listen!
A second ship.

(Kurwenal starts and looks over the escarpment while the Shepherd, horrified, looks at Tristan and Isolde from a distance)

KURWENAL
(in an outbreak of rage)
Death and damnation!
To your posts!
I have made out
Mark and Melot!
Weapons and stones!
Help me! To the gate!

(He hurries with the shepherd to the gate,
which they try to barricade hastily)

THE HELMSMAN
(rushing in)
Mark is behind me
with armed men and people.
Resistance is useless!
We are overpowered.

KURWENAL
Take up your post and help!
As long as I live
nobody is going to spy on me here!

BRANGÄNE'S VOICE
(coming from outside)
Isolde! My mistress!

KURWENAL
Brangaene calling?

(calling down the slope)

What do you want here?

BRANGÄNE
Do not bar the gate, Kurwenal!
Where is Isolde?

KURWENAL
You too a traitor?
Woe to you, villanous woman!

MELOT
(outside)
Get back, you fool!
Do not resist!

KURWENAL
(laughing wildly)
Heyahaha! The day
that I strike you down!

(Melot, witharmed men, appears below the gate. Kurwenal attacks him and fells him to the ground)

KURWENAL
Die shameful wretch!

MELOT
Alas, Tristan!

(He dies)

BRANGÄNE
(still outside)
Kurwenal, are you mad?
Listen, you are betraying yourself!

KURWENAL
Faithless maid!

(to his men)

Come on! Follow me!
Throw them back!

(They fight)

MARK
(outside)
Stop, you madman!
Have you lost your senses?

KURWENAL
Here death rages!
Nothing else, King,
is to be had here;
if that is what you want, come on!

(He sets about Mark
and his followers)

MARK
(appearing under the gate
with some men)
Get back, madman!

BRANGÄNE
(has climbed in over the wall at the side
and hurries forward)

Isolde! Mistress!
Joy and salvation!
What do I see? Ah!
Are you alive? Isolde!

(She tends Isolde. - Mark and his men have driven Kurwenal and his followes back from the gate and force their way in)

MARK
Deceit and madness!
Tristan, where are you?

KURWENAL
(badly wounded, staggers forward
before Mark)

There he lies -
here - where I lie.

(He collapses at Tristan's feet)

MARK
Tristan! Tristan!
Isolde! Alas!

KURWENAL
(grasping Tristan's hand)
Tristan! Faithful friend!
Do not scold me
if your faithful friend comes with you!

(He dies)

MARK
All dead then!
All dead!
My hero, my Tristan!
Most faithful of friends,
must you even today
betray your friend?
Today, when he comes
to avow to you his deepest faith?
Awake! Awake!
Awake! to my wailing!

(Sobbing, he bends
over the bodies)

You faithless, most faithful of friends!

BRANGÄNE
(who has brought Isolde
to her senses in her arms)

She wakes! She is alive!
Isolde! Listen to me,
hear my repentance!
The draught's secret
I have revealed to the King;
In anxious haste
he put out to sea
to reach you,
to renounce you,
to lead your beloved to you.

MARK
Why, Isolde,
why have you done this?
When it was clearly revealed to me
what I had not been able to comprehend,
how happy I was that I found
my friend free of guilt.
To wed you to
this glorious man
with full sail
I flew after you.
But misfortune's
impetuous haste,
how can the bringer of peace control it?
I increased the harvest of Death,
madness added yet more distress.

BRANGÄNE
Can you not hear us?
Isolde! Dearest!
Can you not hear your faithful Brangaene?

(Isolde, aware of nothing round about her, fixes her gaze with mounting ecstasy upon Tristan's body)

ISOLDE
How softly and gently
he smiles,
how sweetly
his eyes open -
can you see, my friends,
do you not see it?
How he glows
ever brighter,
raising himself high
amidst the stars?
Do you not see it?
How his heart
swells with courage,
gushing full and majestic
in his breast?
How in tender bliss
sweet breath
gently wafts
from his lips -
Friends! Look!
Do you not feel and see it?
Do I alone hear
this melody
so wondrously
and gently
sounding from within him,
in bliss lamenting,
all-expressing,
gently reconciling,
piercing me,
soaring aloft,
its sweet echoes
resounding about me?
Are they gentle
aerial waves
ringing out clearly,
surging around me?
Are they billows
of blissful fragrance?
As they seethe
and roar about me,
shall I breathe,
shall I give ear?
Shall I drink of them,
plunge beneath them?
Breathe my life away
in sweet scents?
In the heaving swell,
in the resounding echoes,
in the universal stream
of the world-breath -
to drown,
to founder -
unconscious -
utmost bliss!

(Isolde sinks gently, as if transfigured, in Brangaene's arms, on to Tristan's body. Those standing around are awed and deeply moved. Mark blesses the bodies. - The curtain falls slowly)
