ACT ONE

A hill near Nagasaki
A Japanese house, with terraced garden. At back,
below, the harbour and the city. Goro is showing the
house to Pinkerton, who goes from one surprise to
another.

PINKERTON
And ceiling and walls...

GORO
Go back and forth at will,
so that you can enjoy
from the same spot
different views to the usual ones.

PINKERTON
Where is
the nuptial nest?

GORO
Here, or there...depending...

PINKERTON
It has false ends,, too!
And the living room?

GORO (indicating the terrace)
There it is!

PINKERTON
In the open air?

GORO
One side slides along...

PINKERTON
I understand!
Another one...

GORO
...glides along!

PINKERTON
And this ridiculous little place...

GORO
Solid as a tower,
from floor to ceiling.

PINKERTON
...is a concertina house.

GORO
(claps his hands and two men and a woman enter and
kneel before Pinkerton.)
This is the maid
who was your bride's
faithful servant before.
The cook. The manservant. They are embarrassed
by the great honour.

PINKERTON
Their names?

GORO
"Miss Light Cloud."
"Ray of the Rising Sun."
"The Aromatic One."

SUZUKI
Your Honour is smiling?
Laughter is fruit and flower.
The wise Ocunama has said:
"A smile breaks through
a web of trouble.
It opens the shell for the pearl,
to man it opens the gates
of Paradise.
Perfume of the gods...
fountain of life... "
The wise Ocunama has said:
"A smile breaks through a web of troubles."
(Goro realizes that Pinkerton is bored. He claps his
hands. The three servants run back into the house.)

PINKERTON
By her chattering
she seems just like all woman the world over.
What are you looking at?

GORO
To see if the bride's coming yet.

PINKERTON
Is everything ready?

GORO
Everything.

PINKERTON
Priceless pearl of a marriage-broker!

GORO
The Registrar,
the relations,
your Consul and the bride
will all come here.
You'll sign the documents here,
and you'll be married.

PINKERTON
And are there many relations?

GORO
The mother-in-law, the grandmother,
her uncle the Bonze (who won't
honour us with his presence),
and her male and female cousins...
Let's say, with ancestors
and contemporaries, about two dozen.
As for descendants...
Your Grace and the pretty Butterfly
will take good care of that.

PINKERTON
You priceless pearl of a marriage-broker!

VOICE OF SHARPLESS
You sweat and climb,
puff and stumble!

GORO
The Consul's coming up.

SHARPLESS (appearing, out of breath)
Those stones
have reduced me to a jelly!

PINKERTON
Welcome!

GORO
Welcome!

SHARPLESS
Uff!

PINKERTON
Quick, Goro,
some refreshments.

SHARPLESS
It's high up, here!

PINKERTON
But, it's beautiful!

SHARPLESS
Nagasaki, the sea, the harbour...

PINKERTON
And a little house
that works by magic.

SHARPLESS
Is it yours?

PINKERTON
I've bought it for nine hundred
and ninety-nine years,
with the right, every month,
to cancel the agreement.
In this country
houses and contracts
are equally elastic.

SHARPLESS
And the clever man makes the most of it.

PINKERTON
Certainly.
(Goro hurries from the house, followed by two servants
bearing glasses, bottles, plates, cutlery and two wicker
chairs. They lay two places at a little table, and return
to the house.)
Everywhere in the world
the roving Yankee
takes his pleasure and his profit,
indifferent to all risks.
He drops anchor
at random...
(He breaks off to offer a drink to Sharpless.)
Milk punch or whisky?
...He drops anchor
at random
till a sudden squall wrecks
the ship, hawsers rigging and all...
He's not satisfied with life
unless he makes his own
the flowers of every shore...

SHARPLESS
It's an easy-going creed.

PINKERTON
...the love of every pretty girl.

SHARPLESS
...an easy-going creed
that makes life delightful
but saddens the heart.

PINKERTON
If beaten,
he tries his luck again.
He follows his bent
wherever he may be.
So I'm marrying
in Japanese fashion
for nine hundred and
ninety-nine years. With the right
to be freed every month!

SHARPLESS
It's an easy-going creed.

PINKERTON
"America for ever!"

SHARPLESS
"America for ever!"
And is the bride pretty?

GORO (overhearing, comes forward.)
A garland of fresh flowers,
a star with golden rays...

And for next to nothing: only a hundred yen.
If your Grace wishes
I have a good selection.

PINKERTON
Go and fetch her, Goro.

SHARPLESS
What madness has got hold of you!
Are you completely
infatuated?

PINKERTON
I don't know! It depends
on the degree of infatuation!
Love or passing fancy -
I couldn't say.
She's certainly bewitched me
with her innocent arts.
Delicate and fragile as blown glass,
in stature, in bearing
she resembles some figure on a painted screen,
but as, from her background of glossy lacquer,
with a sudden movement
she frees herself; like a butterfly
she flutters and settles
with such quiet grace
that a madness seizes me
to pursue her,
even though I might
damage her wings.

SHARPLESS
The day before yesterday she came
to visit the Consulate.

I didn't see her myself
but I heard her speak.
The mystery of her voice
touched me to the heart.
True love surely
speaks like that.
It would be a great sin
to strip off those delicate wings
and perhaps plunge a trusting heart into despair.
That heavenly, meek, pretty, little voice
shouldn't utter a note of sadness!

PINKERTON
My dear Consul,
don't worry! It's usual
at your age to take a pessimistic view.
There's no great harm done
if I want those wings
to be spread in love's tender flight!
Whisky?

SHARPLESS
Another little glassful.
Here's to your family at home.

PINKERTON
And to the day when I shall get married
in real earnest
to a real American bride.

GORO (re-enters at a run)
Here they come! They've reached
the top of the hill.
You can already hear the swarm

of women rustling like
leaves in the wind!

GIRLS' VOICES
Ah! Ah!
What an expanse of sky!
What an expanse of sea!

VOICE OF BUTTERFLY
Just one more step now...

GIRLS' VOICES
How slow you are!

VOICE OF BUTTERFLY
Wait.

GIRLS' VOICES
Here we are at the summit!
Look, just look at all the flowers!

VOICE OF BUTTERFLY
Over land and sea there floats
a joyous breath of spring.

SHARPLESS
Oh, the gay chatter of youth!

VOICE OF BUTTERFLY
I am the happiest
girl in Japan,
or rather,in the whole world.
Friends, I have come
at the call of love...

I have come to the portals of love
where is gathered the happiness
of all who live and die.

GIRLS' VOICES
Joy to you, sweet friend,
but before crossing
the threshold which draws you,
turn and look at
the things which you hold dear,
look at all that sky,
all those flowers and all that sea!

BUTTERFLY
We have arrived.
(She sees the group of men and recognises Pinkerton.
She closes her parasol smartly, and points Pinkerton
out to her friends.)
B. F. Pinkerton. Down.

GIRL FRIENDS
Down.

BUTTERFLY
Good luck attend you.

GIRL FRIENDS
Our respects.

PINKERTON
The climb is
rather difficult?

BUTTERFLY
To a court bride
impatience is more trying.

PINKERTON
A very rare complement.

BUTTERFLY
I know some even prettier ones.

PINKERTON
Real gems!

BUTTERFLY
If you like, this very instant...

PINKERTON
Thank you...no.

SHARPLESS
Miss Butterfly. A pretty name -
it suits you to perfection.
Do you come from Nagasaki?

BUTTERFLY
Yes, sir. From a family
which at one time was quite well-to-do.
(to her friends)
Isn't that so?

GIRL FRIENDS
It is!

BUTTERFLY
No one ever admits
he was born in poverty.
There's not a beggar
who, to hear him, doesn't
come of high lineage. All the same,
I have known riches.
But storms uproot
the sturdiest oaks...
and we became geishas
to support ourselves.
(to her friends)
That's so, isn't it?

GIRL FRIENDS
It is!

BUTTERFLY
I don't hide it,
neither do I feel hard done by.
Why do you laugh?
It's the way of the world.

PINKERTON
With those childlike ways,
when she talks she sets my blood on fire.

SHARPLESS
And have you any sisters?

BUTTERFLY
No, sir. I have my mother.

GORO
A noble lady.

BUTTERFLY
But without wronging her,
very poor, too.

SHARPLESS
And your father?

BUTTERFLY (abruptly)
Dead.

SHARPLESS
How old are you?

BUTTERFLY
Guess.

SHARPLESS
Ten.

BUTTERFLY
Make it more.

SHARPLESS
Twenty.

BUTTERFLY
Make it less.
Just exactly fifteen;
I'm already old.

SHARPLESS
Fifteen!

PINKERTON
Fifteen!

SHARPLESS
The age for games...

PINKERTON
...and wedding cake.

GORO
The Imperial Commissioner,
the Registrar,
the bride's family.

PINKERTON
Get on with it quickly.
(Goro runs into the house. Pinkerton talks apart to the
Consul.)
What a farce, this parade
of my new relations,

COUSIN and RELATIONS
He's not handsome, truly.
He's not handsome.

BUTTERFLY
He's so handsome
one just couldn't imagine anything better!

MOTHER and FRIENDS
He seems like a king to me.
He's worth a fortune.

COUSIN (to Butterfly)
Goro offered him to me too,
but he has got no for an answer!

BUTTERFLY
Of course, you would!

RELATIONS (to cousin)
Her looks have already faded.
He'll divorce her.

COUSIN and RELATIONS
I hope so.

UNCLE YAKUSIDE
Is there any wine here?
Let's have a look.
I've just seen some the colour of tea,
and some red!

GORO
For goodness sake, keep quiet!
Sh! Sh! Sh!

SHARPLESS
My lucky young friend!
Lucky Pinkerton,
on whom Fate has bestowed
this newly opened flower!

PINKERTON
Yes, it's true, she's a flower, a flower!
Her exotic fragrance
has turned my head.

COUSIN and RELATIONS
He offered him to me too,
but I answered I don't want him!

MOTHER and FRIENDS
He's too handsome, he seems like a king to me!
I wouldn't have answered no,
I would never have said no!

SHARPLESS
No lovelier girl have I ever seen
than this Butterfly.
And if you don't take this contract
and her trust seriously...

COUSIN and RELATIONS
Without looking too hard
I've found better,
and I shall roundly tell him no!

MOTHER and FRIENDS
No, my dears, I didn't think so,
he's a real gentleman,
and I would not say no!

BUTTERFLY
Attention, listen to me.

PINKERTON
Yes, it's true, she's a flower, a flower,
and, upon my honour, I've plucked her!

SHARPLESS
...Beware! She believes in them!

BUTTERFLY
Mother, come here.
Listen to me:

attention, come now,
one, two, three,
and everybody down.
(They all bow low in front of Pinkerton and Sharpless.
Pinkerton takes Butterfly's hand.)

PINKERTON
Come, my love,
do you like our little house?

BUTTERFLY
Mr. B. F. Pinkerton, excuse me...
I would like.. a few woman's possessions...

PINKERTON
Where are they?

BUTTERFLY
They're here...you don't mind?
(She produces various small objects from the capacious sleeves of her kimono.)

PINKERTON
Why ever should I, my pretty Butterfly?

BUTTERFLY
Handkerchiefs. Pipe.
A sash. A little clasp.
A mirror. A fan.

PINKERTON
What's that pot?

BUTTERFLY
A jar of rouge.

PINKERTON
Oh dear!

BUTTERFLY
Don't you like it?
(She throws it away.)
A way with it!

PINKERTON
And that?

BUTTERFLY
My most sacred possession.

PINKERTON
And mayn't one see it?

BUTTERFLY
There are too many people.
Forgive me.

GORO (whispering to Pinkerton)
It's a present from the Mikado
to her father...inviting him to...
(He imitates the gesture of hara-kiri.)

PINKERTON
And her father?

GORO
Obeyed.

BUTTERFLY
(taking some statuettes from her sleeve)
My Ottoke.

PINKERTON
These puppets? You said?

BUTTERFLY
They are the spirits of my ancestors.

PINKERTON
Oh! My respects.

BUTTERFLY
Yesterday I went, alone
and in secret, to the Mission.
With my new life
I can adopt a new religion.
My uncle, the Bonze, doesn't know,
neither do my people.
I follow my destiny
and, filled with humility,
I kneel before
Mr. Pinkerton's God.
It is my fate.
In the same little church,
beside you on my knees,
I will pray to the same God,
and to please you I may perhaps be able
to forget my own people.
My dearest love!

GORO
Quiet, everybody!

COMMISSIONER
It is permitted to the herein named
Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton,
Lieutenant in the warship Lincoln,

United States Navy,
North America,
and to Miss Butterfly
of the Omara district of Nagasaki,
to be united in matrimony,
the first by right
of his own wish
and she by consent of her relations
here witness to the contract.

GORO (with ceremony)
The bridegroom.
Then the bride.
And everything's concluded.

FRIENDS
Madam Butterfly!

BUTTERFLY
Madam B. F. Pinkerton.

COMMISSIONER
My best wishes.

PINKERTON
Many thanks.

COMMISSIONER
Are you going, sir?

SHARPLESS
I'll go along with you.
(to Pinkerton)
See you tomorrow.

PINKERTON
Capital.

OFFICIAL REGISTRAR
May you have many descendants.

PINKERTON
I'll try.

SHARPLESS (going, to Pinkerton)
Have a care!
(Sharpless, the Rigstrar and the Commissioner leave.)

PINKERTON(to himself)
And here we are in the family circle!
Let's get rid of all these people
as soon as we decently can.
(He raises his glass.)
Hip! Hip!

RELATIONS
O Kami! O Kami!

PINKERTON
Let's drink to the new ties.
(Suddenly a terrifying character appears. It is the
Bonze, who comes forward in a rage; holding his hand
out towards Butterfly, he threatens her.)

BONZE
Cho-Cho-San! Abomination!

BUTTERFLY and RELATIONS
Our uncle the Bonze!

GORO
Confound the spoilsport!
Who will rid us
of such nuisances?

BONZE
Cho-Cho-San! What were you up to
at the Mission?

ALL
Answer, Cho-Cho-San!

PINKERTON
What's that madman shouting about?

BONZE
Answer, what were you about?
What, can your eyes be dry!
So then, these are the fruits?
She has renounced us all.

ALL
Oh, Cho-Cho-San!

BONZE
I tell you she has renounced
our ancient faith.

ALL
Oh! Cho-Cho-San!

BONZE
Kami sarundasico!
What torments
threaten your lost soul!

PINKERTON
Hey, that's enough, I say!

BONZE
Come, everybody!
Let us go!
You have renounced us and we
renounce you!

PINKERTON
Get out of here at once.
I'll have no shindy in my house
and none of this bonzing!

ALL (leaving)
Oh! Cho-Cho-San! Kami sarundasico!
Oh! Cho-Cho-San! We renounce you!

PINKERTON
Dear child, don't cry
over that croaking of frogs.

RELATIONS (far off)
Oh! Cho-Cho-San!

BUTTERFLY
They're still howling!

PINKERTON
The whole tribe of them
and all the bonzes in Japan
aren't worth a tear
from your sweet, pretty eyes!

BUTTERFLY
Really? Then I won't cry any more.
And I scarcely mind
their repudiation
because of your words
which echo so sweetly in my heart.
(She kisses his hand.)

PINKERTON
What are you doing? My hand?

BUTTERFLY
I've been told that over there
among well-bred people
it's a sign
of the greatest respect.

SUZUKI (from inside the house)
Izaghi, Izanami sarundasico,
Kami, Izaghi,
Izanami sarundasico, Kami.

PINKERTON
Who's that muttering in there?

BUTTERFLY
It's Suzuki saying
her evening prayers.

PINKERTON
Night is falling.

BUTTERFLY
And darkness and peace.

PINKERTON
And you are here alone.

BUTTERFLY
Alone and renounced!
Renounced and happy!

PINKERTON
(claps; the servants run out.)
Come here and close up the house.

BUTTERFLY
Yes, yes, we are all alone...
and the world shut outside...

PINKERTON
And the furious Bonze.

BUTTERFLY
Suzuki, my clothes.
(Suzuki goes to a chest and gives Butterfly her night
clothes.)

SUZUKI
Good night.

BUTTERFLY
I long to take off
this ceremonial sash,
let the bride be dressed
in pure white.
Whispering to himself
he smiles and watches me.

If I could only hide!
It makes me blush so!
And still the angry voice
is cursing me...
Butterfly renounced,
renounced... and happy.

PINKERTON
With squirrel-like movements
she shakes the knots loose and undoes them!
To think that this little toy
is my wife! My wife!
But she displays such grace
that I am consumed
by a fever
of sudden desire!
(Pinkerton approaches Butterfly, who has finished
dressing.)
Dear child, with eyes full of witchery,
now you are all mine.
You're dressed all in lily-white.
I love your dark tresses
amid the white of your veils.

BUTTERFLY
I am like the moon-goddess,
the little goddess of the moon,
who comes down at night
from the bridge of heaven.

PINKERTON
And captivates all hearts...

BUTTERFLY
...and takes them and folds them
in a white cloak.
And carries them away
to the higher regions.

PINKERTON
But meanwhile, you haven't told me yet,
you haven't told me you love me.
Does that goddess know the words
that satisfy burning desire?

BUTTERFLY
She does. Maybe she's unwilling
to say them for fear of dying of it,
for fear of dying of it!

PINKERTON
Foolish fear -
love does not kill,
but gives life and smiles
for heavenly joy,
as it does now
in your almond eyes.

BUTTERFLY
For me you are now
the eye of heaven.
And I liked you from the first moment
I set eyes on you.
You are tall and strong.
You laugh out so heartily.
And you say things
I've never heard in my life before.
I'm happy now, so happy.

Love me with a little love,
a child-like love,
the kind that suits me.
Love me, please...
We are a people used to small,
modest, quiet things,
to a tenderness gently caressing,
yet vast as the sky
and as the waves of the sea.

PINKERTON
Give me your dear hands
and let me kiss them!
My Butterfly!
How aptly you were named,
fragile butterfly!

BUTTERFLY
They say that overseas
if it should fall into the hands of man
a butterfly is stuck through
with a pin
and fixed to a board!

PINKERTON
There's some truth in that;
and do you know why?
So that it shouldn't fly away again.
I've caught you...
Quivering, I press you to me.
You're mine.

BUTTERFLY
Yes, for life.

PINKERTON
Come along, come...
Cast all sad fears
out of your heart!
The night is clear! See,
all things sleep!
You are mine! Oh, come!

BUTTERFLY
Oh, lovely night! What a lot of stars!
Never have I seen them so beautiful!
Every spark twinkles and shines
with the brilliance of an eye.
Oh! What a lot of eyes fixed and staring,
looking at us from all sides!
In the sky, along the shore,
out to sea...the sky is smiling!
Oh, lovely night!
In a ecstasy of love
the sky is smiling!

ACT TWO

Inside Butterfly's house
(Suzuki is praying in front of a statue of Buddha,
occasionally ringing the prayer-bell. Butterfly is
standing, erect and immobile, by a screen.)

SUZUKI
Izaghi, Izanami,
sarundasico Kami...
Oh, my head!
And thou, Ten-Sjoo-daj,

don't let Butterfly
cry any more, any more.

BUTTERFLY
Fat and lazy
are the gods of Japan.
The American God,
I'm sure,
is much quicker in answering
those who pray to him.
But I'm afraid he may not know
we have our home here.
Suzuki...
how long will it be before we run out of money?
(Suzuki opens a little table, takes out a few coins and
shows them to Butterfly.)

SUZUKI
This is all we have left.

BUTTERFLY
This? Oh! We've been too extravagant!

SUZUKI
If he doesn't come back, and soon,
we shall be in a bad way.

BUTTERFLY
But he will come back!

SUZUKI
He will come back?

BUTTERFLY
Why does he arrange for the Consul
to look after the rent?
Tell me, quick!
Why did he take such care to have
the house fitted with locks
if he didn't mean to come back again?

SUZUKI
I don't know.

BUTTERFLY
You don't know?
I'll tell you then:
in order to keep mosquitos,
relations and troubles outside,
and inside, jealously guarded,
his bride -
his bride - me - Butterfly!

SUZUKI
No one has ever heard
of a foreign husband
returning to his home.

BUTTERFLY
Be quiet, or I'll kill you!
On that last morning,
"Are you coming back, sir?"
I asked him.
With a heavy heart,
trying to hide his unhappiness from me,
smiling he replied:
"Oh, Butterfly,
my dear sweet little wife,

I'll return with the roses
in that happy season
when the robin
builds his nest."
He'll come back.

SUZUKI
Let us hope so.

BUTTERFLY
Say it with me.
He'll come back.

SUZUKI
He'll come back.

BUTTERFLY
You're crying? Whatever for?
Oh, you are lacking in faith!
Listen.
One fine day we'll see
a wisp of smoke arising
over the extreme verge of the sea's horizon,
and afterwards the ship will appear.
Then the white ship
will enter the harbour, will thunder
a salute. You see?
He's arrived!
I shan't go down to meet him.
No, I shall stand there
on the brow of the hill and wait,
and wait a long time,
and I shan't find
the long wait wearisome.

And from the midst of the city crowd
a man - a tiny speck -
will make his way up the hill.
Who can it be?
And when he arrives -
what, what will he say?
He'll call, "Butterfly!"
from the distance.
Not answering, I'll
remain hidden,
partly to tease,
and partly so as not to die
at the first meeting.
And, a trifle worried,
he'll call, he'll call
"My dear little wife,
fragrance of verbena!" -
the names he used to call me
when he came here.
And this will happen,
I promise you.
Keep your fears;
with unalterable faith I shall wait for him.
(She dismisses Suzuki, who leaves. Sharpless and Goro
can be seen entering the garden.)

GORO
She's there. Go in.

SHARPLESS
Excuse me...Madam Butterfly...

BUTTERFLY
Madam Pinkerton, please.
(She turns round.)

Oh! My dear consul,
my dear sir!

SHARPLESS
You remember me?

BUTTERFLY
Welcome to an American house.

SHARPLESS
Thank you.

BUTTERFLY
Your grandparents and ancestors are quite well?

SHARPLESS
I sincerely hope so.

BUTTERFLY
Will you smoke?
(She beckons to Suzuki to prepare the pipe.)

SHARPLESS
Thank you. I have here...

BUTTERFLY
Sir, I see the skies are blue.

SHARPLESS
No thank you. I have...

BUTTERFLY
Perhaps you would prefer American cigarettes?

SHARPLESS
Thank you. I have to show you...

BUTTERFLY (offering Sharpless a light)
Here you are.

SHARPLESS
Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton has written to me...

BUTTERFLY
Really! Is he quite well?

SHARPLESS
Perfectly.

BUTTERFLY
I am the happiest woman in Japan.
May I ask you a question?

SHARPLESS
Certainly.

BUTTERFLY
When do the robins make their nests
in America?

SHARPLESS
What did you say?

BUTTERFLY
Yes...before or after they do here?

SHARPLESS
But...why?

SHARPLESS
My husband promised
to return in that happy season
when the robin builds his nest again.
Here, it has done so
three times already, but it may be
that over there it doesn't nest so often.
Who's that laughing?
Oh, it's the marriage-broker.
A bad man.

GORO
I am enjoying...

BUTTERFLY
Be quiet.
(to Sharpless)
He dared...
No, first answer my question.

SHARPLESS
I'm sorry, but I don't know.
I haven't studied ornithology.

BUTTERFLY
Orni...

SHARPLESS
...thology.

BUTTERFLY
So you don't know, then.

SHARPLESS
No. We were saying...

BUTTERFLY
Ah, yes... Goro, as soon as
B. F. Pinkerton was at sea,
he came annoying me
with gossip and presents,
offering me first this one,
then that one in second marriage.
Now he's promising me riches
from a silly idiot.

GORO
The rich Yamadori.
She hasn't a penny.
Her relations
have all renounced her.
(Beyond the terrace Yamadori can be seen approaching
on a palanquin, surrounded by servants.)

BUTTERFLY
There he is. Look.
Yamadori...
aren't you disillusioned
with love's pains yet?
Do you still intend to cut your veins
if I refuse you a kiss?

YAMADORI
One of the most annoying things
is hopeless sighing.

BUTTERFLY
You've had so many wives by now
you must be used to it.

YAMADORI
I married them, one and all,
and divorce has set me free.

BUTTERFLY
Most obliged.

YAMADORI
But to you I would vow
to be faithful.

SHARPLESS
I'm afraid I shan't succeed
in delivering the message...

GORO
Villas, servants, gold, and at Omara
a princely palace!

BUTTERFLY
My troth is plighted already.

GORO and YAMADORI (to Sharpless)
She thinks she's married.

BUTTERFLY
I don't think so - I am. I am.

GORO
But the law...

BUTTERFLY
I don't know anything about that.

GORO
...for the wife has made desertion
equivalent to divorce.

BUTTERFLY
The Japanese law...
not that of my country now.

GORO
Which country?

BUTTERFLY
The United States.

SHARPLESS
Poor thing!

BUTTERFLY
We're quite aware that to open the door
and chase out the wife
with no further ado
is called divorce here.
But in America you can't do that.
(to Sharpless)
Can you?

SHARPLESS
No. But...

BUTTERFLY
There, a good judge, grave
and upright, says to the husband:

"You want to go away?
Let us hear why?"
"I'm bored
with married life!"
And the magistrate:
"You rascal,
into prison with you, quick!"
Tea, Suzuki.

YAMADORI
You heard?

SHARPLESS
Such utter
blindness grieves me deeply.

GORO
Pinkerton's ship
is already signalled.

YAMADORI
When she sees him again...

SHARPLESS
He doesn't wish to show himself.
I have come expressly
to relieve her of any illusions on that score.

BUTTERFLY
If your Grace will allow...
What tiresome people!

YAMADORI
Farewell. I leave you
with my heart full of grief,
but I still hope...

BUTTERFLY
Please yourself.

YAMADORI
Oh, if only you would...

BUTTERFLY
The trouble is, I don't want to.
(Yamadori leaves. Goro follows him.)

SHARPLESS
Our turn now.
Sit down here.
Will you read
this letter with me?

BUTTERFLY
Give it to me.
(She takes it and kisses it, then gives it back to the
Consul.)
To my lips, on my heart...
You're the kindest man in the whole world.
Please begin.

SHARPLESS
"My dear friend, will you go and see
that pretty flower of a girl... "

BUTTERFLY
Does he really say that?

SHARPLESS
Yes, he does,
but if every moment...

BUTTERFLY
I'll keep quiet, I'll keep quiet.
I won't interrupt any more.

SHARPLESS
"Since that happy time
three years have gone by... "

BUTTERFLY
He's counted them, too!

SHARPLESS
"And perhaps Butterfly
does not remember me any more."

BUTTERFLY
Not remember him?
- Suzuki, tell him.
"Does not remember me any more... "

SHARPLESS
Patience!
"If she still loves me,
if she expects me... "

BUTTERFLY
Oh, what sweet words!
You blessed, blessed letter!

SHARPLESS
"I beg you to be so good as,
with tact, to prepare her gently..."

BUTTERFLY
He's coming.

SHARPLESS
"... for the blow."

BUTTERFLY
When? Quick! Quick!

SHARPLESS (to himself)
This is fine, I must say!
I must break it to her without more ado.
That devil of a Pinkerton!
(to Butterfly)
Well now, what would you do,
Madam Butterfly,
if he were never
to return?

BUTTERFLY
I could do one of two things:
go back to entertaining people
with my songs;
or better, die.

SHARPLESS
It grieves me deeply to rob you
of your illusions.
Accept the proposal
of the wealthy Yamadori.

BUTTERFLY
You! You, sir, tell me this! You!

SHARPLESS
Great God, what am I to do?

BUTTERFLY
Come here quickly, Suzuki.
His Grace is going.

SHARPLESS
Are you turning me out?

BUTTERFLY
Please,
forget what I said.

SHARPLESS
I was brutal,
I don't deny it.

BUTTERFLY
Oh, you hurt me so much,
so much, so very much!
It's nothing, nothing! I thought I was going to die,
but it soon passes like
clouds over the sea...
Has he forgotten me, then?
(Going into the inner room, she returns with a child in
her arms.)
And this? And this?
Can he forget this as well?

SHARPLESS
It is his?

BUTTERFLY
Whoever saw a
Japanese child with blue eyes?
And his mouth?
And his curls of pure gold?

SHARPLESS
It's obvious. And does Pinkerton know?

BUTTERFLY
No, no. The child was born
after he'd gone back
to that great country of his. But you
will write him
that a son without equal
is waiting for him here!
And then you'll see
if he doesn't come hurrying
over the land and sea!
Do you know what that gentleman
had the heart to think?
That your mother would have
to take you in her arms
and in all weathers
walk the city streets
to earn you
food and clothing,
and to the pitying crowd
stretch out a trembling hand,
crying, "Listen, listen
to my sad tale.
Charity for an unhappy mother!
Have pity!"
And Butterfly - oh, horrible fate -
will dance for you!

And as she used to do,
the geisha will sing!
And the gay and merry song
will end in a sob!
Oh no, no, never!
Not that profession
which leads to dishonour!
Rather let me die! To dance no more!
I will cut my life short rather!
Oh, let me die!

SHARPLESS (to himself)
How pitiful!
(to Butterfly)
I must go back now.
Will you forgive me?

BUTTERFLY
You... give him your hand.

SHARPLESS
What pretty fair curls!
What is your name, darling?

BUTTERFLY
Answer:
My name is Sorrow now.
But when you write
to Daddy tell him
that the day he comes back
I shall be called Joy, Joy!

SHARPLESS
Your father shall know it. I promise you.
(He leaves hurriedly.)

SUZUKI (shouting outside)
Serpent! Accursed toad!
(She comes in, dragging Goro by the ear.)

BUTTERFLY
What's happened?

SUZUKI
He buzzes round us,
the vampire! And every day
to the four winds he spreads abroad
that nobody knows
who the baby's father is!

GORO
I only said
that over there in America
when a child is born so unfortunate
he will always be an outcast
among people!

BUTTERFLY
Ah! you lie! you lie! you lie!
Say it again and I'll kill you!

SUZUKI
No!

BUTTERFLY
Get out!
You'll see, my little love,
my sorrow and my comfort,
my little love,
oh, you will see, your avenger will

take us far, far away
to his own country...he'll take us far away.
(A cannon is heard.)

SUZUKI
The harbour gun!
A warship!

BUTTERFLY
It's white... white... the American flag!
with the stars...
Now it's manoeuvring to drop anchor.
(She takes the telescope.)
Steady my hand
so that I can see the name...
the name, the name...
There it is: Abraham Lincoln!
They all lied! The lot of them!
I alone knew...
Only I who love him.
Do you see how foolish your doubts were?
He's come! He's come! He's come!
Just at the very moment
when everybody said:
weep and despair!
My love triumphs, yes, triumphs!
My faith is completely vindicated!
He has come back and he loves me!
Shake that branch of the cherry tree
and rain down
blooms on me.
I want to plunge
my burning brow in its fragrant rain.

SUZUKI
Madam, calm yourself...those tears...

BUTTERFLY
No, no, I'm laughing!
How long shall we have to wait for him?
What do you think? An hour?

SUZUKI
Longer.

BUTTERFLY
Two hours, maybe.
Everywhere
must be full of flowers,
as the night is of stars.
Go and pick the flowers!

SUZUKI
All of them?

BUTTERFLY
All of them, all, all.
Peach blossom, violets, jasmine -
every bush, plant
and tree that's in flower!

SUZUKI
The whole garden will be
as desolate as winter.

BUTTERFLY
I want all the perfume
of spring in here.

SUZUKI
The whole garden will be
as desolate as winter.
Here you are, Madam.

BUTTERFLY
Pick some more.

SUZUKI
You used to come to this hedge
so often to gaze in tears,
far out over the empty expanse.

BUTTERFLY
The long-awaited one has come,
I ask nothing more of the sea,
I gave tears to the soil,
it gives its flowers to me!

SUZUKI
The garden's bare.

BUTTERFLY
Is it? Then come
and help me.

SUZUKI
Roses at the entrance to the threshold.

BUTTERFLY
I want all the perfume of spring
in here.

BUTTERFLY and SUZUKI
Let us sow April all about us.

SUZUKI
Lilies? Violets?

BUTTERFLY
Scatter lilies and violets all about us!
His chair let us twine
with flower garlands!

BUTTERFLY and SUZUKI
By the handful let's scatter
violets and tuberoses,
blossoms of verbena,
petals of every flower!

BUTTERFLY
Now, come and dress me.
But no! First bring me the baby.
I'm no longer what I was.
These lips have breathed too many sighs...
and these eyes have gazed
too hard into the distance.
Give my face
a touch of rouge...
and you too, little one,
so that the long wait
won't leave your cheeks
pale and hollow.

SUZUKI
Keep still,
I have to do your hair.

BUTTERFLY
What will they say now?
And my uncle, the Bonze?

All of them so glad
at my sad plight!
And Yamadori, with his languishing!
Ridiculed, disgraced,
shown up, the unkind creatures!

SUZUKI
I've finished.

BUTTERFLY
The sash I wore as a bride.
Bring it here for me to put on.
I want him to see me dressed
as I was that first day.
And a red poppy
in my hair... like that.
Now we'll make three little holes
in the paper screen to look through,
and we'll stay quiet as mice,
waiting.
(Butterfly leads the baby to the soshi and makes three
holes in it; Suzuki sits on her haunches and looks out.
Butterfly places herself in front of the biggest hole, and
looking outside remains motionless and rigid as a
statue. The baby is between his mother and Suzuki, and
looks outside curiously. Night has fallen. Moon beams
light up the soshi from outside. From far away voices
can be heard humming.)

Humming chorus

It is dawn. Butterfly still stands watching, motionless.
The baby and Susuki are asleep. Sailor's voices are
heard from the harbour below.

SAILORS VOICES (from afar)
Oh eh! Oh eh! Oh eh!

SUZUKI
The sun's up already!
Cho-Cho-San!

BUTTERFLY
He'll come... he'll come, you'll see.

SUZUKI
Go and rest, you're tired out...
When he arrives I'll call you.

BUTTERFLY
Sleep, my love,
sleep on my heart.
You are with God,
and I'm with my sorrow.
On you shine the rays
of the golden stars...
Sleep, my child.

SUZUKI
Poor Butterfly!

BUTTERFLY
Sleep, my love,
sleep on my heart.

You are with god,
and I'm with my sorrow.

SUZUKI
Poor Butterfly!
Who can that be?
Oh!
(Pinkerton and Sharpless enter.)

PINKERTON
Hush! Hush! Don't wake her.

SUZUKI
She was quite worn out!
She has been standing waiting for you
all night long with the baby.

PINKERTON
How did she know?

SUZUKI
For three years now
no ship has put into the harbour
without Butterfly scrutinising
its colour and flag from afar.

SHARPLESS (to Pinkerton)
I told you, didn't I?

SUZUKI
I'll call her...

PINKERTON
No, not yet.

SUZUKI
You see, last night
she insisted on strewing
flowers all over the room.

SHARPLESS
I told you, didn't I?

PINKERTON
This is dreadful!

SUZUKI
Who's that out there in the garden?
It's a woman!

PINKERTON
Hush!

SUZUKI
Who is it? Who is it?

SHARPLESS
Best tell her everything.

SUZUKI
Who is it? Who is it?

PINKERTON
She has come with me.

SUZUKI
Who is it? Who is it?

SHARPLESS
His wife.

SUZUKI
Holy spirits of my ancestors!
For the little one
the sun has gone out!

SHARPLESS
We chose this early hour
in order to find you alone, Suzuki,
and in this hour of trial
to seek some means of consolation
and support with you.

SUZUKI
What's the use? What's the use?

SHARPLESS
I know that for her deep distress
there is no consolation.
But it is necessary to provide
for the child's future.

PINKERTON
Oh, the bitter perfume
of these flowers
is poison to the heart!
The room where we loved
is unchanged...

SHARPLESS
That kind woman
who dares not enter
will care like a mother
for the child.

SUZUKI
Oh, I'm so miserable!
And you want me
to ask a mother...

SHARPLESS
Come, speak to that kind lady
and bring her in here.
Even if Butterfly should see her,
no matter... On the contrary,
better if she should realize
the truth through seeing her.
Come, Suzuki, come...

PINKERTON
But the coldness of death is in here.
My picture!...
Three years have passed,
and she has counted the days
and the hours!
I can't stay here...
Sharpless, I'll wait for you
on the way back...

SHARPLESS
Didn't I tell you so?

PINKERTON
You give her some help...
I am completely crushed by remorse.

SHARPLESS
I told you! Do you remember?
When she gave you her hand,

"Beware!" I said, "she believes in all this!"
and my words were prophetic then!
Deaf to advice,
deaf to all doubts, a victim of scorn,
obstinately waiting,
she fortified her heart.

PINKERTON
Yes, all in an instant
I see how I have sinned
and realise I shall never
find respite from this torture.
Never!

SHARPLESS
Go.
The sad truth
she'll learn alone.

PINKERTON
Farewell, flowery refuge
of happiness and love...
Her sweet face will haunt me ever,
torturing me agonizingly.

SHARPLESS
But by now the faithful heart
maybe half suspects. I told you, etc.

PINKERTON
Farewell, flowery refuge...
I can't bear your desolation...
I must fly! I'm beneath contempt!

SHARPLESS
Go, she will learn the sad truth.
(Pinkerton hurries away as Kate and Suzuki come in
from the garden.)

KATE
Will you tell her that?

SUZUKI
I promise.

KATE
And you'll advise her
to trust me?

SUZUKI
Yes.

KATE
I'll care for him like my own son.

SUZUKI
I believe you. But I must
be quite alone with her...
quite alone in this hour of crisis!
She'll cry so bitterly!

BUTTERFLY
Suzuki! Suzuki! Where are you?
Suzuki!

SUZUKI
Here I am...
I was praying tidying up...
No... no... no...
Don't come in... no... no...

BUTTERFLY
He's here, he's here...
where's he hidden?
He's here... he's here...
There's the Consul...
and where?... where?
He isn't here!
That woman?
What does she want at my house?
Nobody speaks!
Why are you crying?
No, don't tell me anything...
I might fall dead on the spot.
You, Suzuki, who are so good,
don't cry!
You love me so much -
yes or no - whisper...
Is he alive?

SUZUKI
Yes.

BUTTERFLY
But he won't come back any more.
They've told you?
Serpent! Will you answer me?

SUZUKI
Never again.

BUTTERFLY
But he arrived yesterday?

SUZUKI
Yes.

BUTTERFLY
Oh, that woman makes
me feel so afraid,
so afraid!

SHARPLESS
She is the innocent cause
of all your misfortunes.
Forgive her.

BUTTERFLY
Ah! she's his wife!
Everything is finished for me!
Everything is over! Oh!

SHARPLESS
Be brave.

BUTTERFLY
They want to take everything
away from me! My son!

SHARPLESS
Make the sacrifice for his sake.

BUTTERFLY
Oh, unhappy mother!
To be obliged to give up my son!
Very well then!
I must obey him in everything.

KATE
Can you ever forgive me, Butterfly?

BUTTERFLY
Under the great dome of heaven,
there isn't a happier woman than you.
May you always be so...
Don't upset yourself about me...

KATE
Poor little thing!

SHARPLESS
It's a terrible shame!

KATE
And will she give up the child?

BUTTERFLY
I'll be able to give up the child to him,
if he'll come and fetch him.
Return up the hill
in half-an-hour's time.

SUZUKI
Like the wings of a captive fly
her little heart is beating!

BUTTERFLY
There's too much light outside,
and too much spring.
Close the screens to.
Where's the baby?

SUZUKI
He's playing...Shall I call him?

BUTTERFLY
Let him play...
Go and keep him company.

SUZUKI
I'll stay with you.

BUTTERFLY
Go along, I order you to.
(Suzuki goes out, crying. Butterfly lights a taper in
front of the sanctuary, and bows. Then she takes her
father's knife from the wall, kisses it, and slowly reads
the inscription on the blade.)
"He dies with honour
who cannot live with honour."
(As she places the blade against her throat, the door
opens and Suzuki's arm pushes the child towards his
mother. Butterfly drops the knife and rushes to the
child, which she seizes up and kisses passionately.)
You? You? You?
Little idol of my heart.
My Love, my love,
flower of the lily and rose.
Never know that, for you,
for your innocent eyes,
Butterfly is about to die...
so that you may go
away beyond the sea
without being subject to remorse
in later years

for your mother's desertion.
Oh, you who have come down to me
from high heaven,
look well, well
on your mother's face,
that you may keep a faint memory of it,
look well!
Little love, farewell!
Farewell, my little love!
Go and play.
(She picks up the child and sets him down on a mat;
she gives him an American flag and a doll to play with
and gently blindfolds his eyes. Picking up the knife she
goes behind the screen. Then appearing from behind
the screen with the white veil clasped round her
throat, Butterfly staggers across the room towards the
baby, and collapses beside him.)

VOICE OF PINKERTON
Butterfly! Butterfly! Butterfly!
(Pinkerton and Sharpless burst into the room, and run
to her side. With a weak gesture Butterfly points to her
child and dies. Pinkerton kneels down beside her, while
Sharpless goes to pick up the child.)
