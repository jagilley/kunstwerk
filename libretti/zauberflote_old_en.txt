Overture

ACT ONE

The scene is a rocky area, here and there
overgrown with trees, on both sides are smallish
hills; there is also a round temple.
(Tamino descends from a rock to the right, in
splendid Japanese hunting-costume, carrying a bow
but no arrows; a serpent pursues him.)

No.1: Introduction

TAMINO
Help me! oh, help me! or I am lost,
condemned as sacrifice to the cunning serpent –
Merciful gods! It’s coming closer!
Ah! save me, ah! defend me!
(He faints; immediately the door to the temple
opens; three veiled ladies come out, each carrying
a silver spear.)

THE THREE LADIES
Die, monster, by our power!

Victory! Victory! Accomplished
is the heroic deed! He is free,
thanks to our bravery.

FIRST LADY (observing him)
A pleasing youth, gentle and fair!

SECOND LADY
The fairest I have ever seen.

THIRD LADY
Yes, that’s true, pretty as a picture.

ALL THREE
If I ever gave my heart away,
it could be to none but this youth.
Let us hasten to our Queen
and report this news to her.
Perhaps this handsome man
can restore her peace of mind.

FIRST LADY
You go and tell her, then;
meanwhile, I’ll stay here. –

SECOND LADY
No, no, you go ahead;
I’ll keep watch over him!

THIRD LADY
No, no, that may not be;
I’ll protect him!

FIRST LADY
Meanwhile, I’ll stay here...

SECOND LADY
I’ll keep watch over him...

THIRD LADY
I’ll protect him myself...

FIRST LADY
...I’ll stay...

SECOND LADY
...I’ll keep watch...

THIRD LADY
...I’ll protect him...

FIRST LADY
...I!

SECOND LADY
...I!

THIRD LADY
...I!

ALL THREE (each to herself)
Then I must go! Aha, very nice!
They want to be alone with him.
No, no, that’s out of the question!
What would I not give
to live with this youth!
If only I had him to myself!
Still no one goes; it is not to be.
I had better go.
O youth so fair and loveable,

O faithful youth, farewell
until I see thee again.
(The Ladies depart. Tamino comes to, and sees
the dead serpent at his feet; but hearing someone
else approach, he hides. Enter Papageno, dressed
in a coat of feathers, bearing large bird cage on
his back and carrying a panpipe.)

No.2: Aria

PAPAGENO
The birdcatcher am I –
and always merry, tra la la!
As the birdcatcher I am known
by old and young throughout the land.
I know how to set decoys
and whistle just like my prey!
So merry and carefree can I be,
knowing all the birds belong to me.
The birdcatcher am I –
and always merry, tra la la!
As the birdcatcher I am known
by old and young throughout the land.
I wish I had a trap for girls –
I’d catch them by the dozen then.
I’d keep them in a cage at home,
and all the girls would be mine alone.
If all the girls were mine alone,
some I’d trade for high-grade sugar,
then to the one I liked the best
I’d give all the sugar she wanted.

And if she then kissed me tenderly,
she’d be my wife and I her husband.
She would sleep beside me
and I would rock her like a child.
(As Papageno is setting down his bird cage, Tamino
steps forward, and learns that Papageno is a
simple fellow, whose awareness of the world is
confined to his little straw hut and his livelihood –
he exchanges the birds he catches for food and
drink brought him by three Ladies of the Queen of
the Night, whose realm this is. Tamino, on the
other hand, is a prince, whose father rules many
lands and peoples. Papageno, really terrified at the
sight of the dead serpent, pretends to have slain
it, until the Ladies enter, masked, to punish him.
They give him water instead of wine, a stone
instead of sugarloaves, and a lock over his mouth
in place of figs. They give Tamino a portrait of the
Queen’s beautiful daughter, and promise that
happiness can be his if he can love her; they go,
followed by Papageno, leaving Tamino alone, gazing
at the portrait.)

No.3: Aria

TAMINO
This portrait is bewitching,
no eye has ever seen its like before.
I feel as if this angelic picture
were filling my heart with a new emotion.
This something I cannot name,
but I feel it burning here.
Can this sensation be love?
Yes, yes! This can only be love.

Oh, if only I might find her!
If only she stood before me!
I would – would warmly – chastely –
what would I do?
I would, in ecstasy,
press her to my ardent heart,
and she would be mine forever!
(He is about to go when the Ladies return,
announcing the arrival of their Queen. She has
observed his emotions, and commissions him to
rescue her daughter from captivity by Sarastro,
High Priest of Isis and Osiris. Darkness; the Queen
appears from beneath the mountains amid thunder
and lightning.)

No.4: Recitative and Aria

QUEEN
O tremble not, beloved son,
you are guiltless, wise and good –
A youth such as you can best console
this overburdened maternal heart. –
I am condemned to grief,
for my daughter has been taken from me.
With her, all my happiness was lost;
a villain abducted her.
I can see her trembling
with fearful agitation,
shaking with fear,
feebly struggling.
I saw her taken from me.
“Ah, help me!” was all she could say –

but her appeals were in vain,
for my aid was not strong enough.
You shall go to set her free,
you shall be my daughter’s saviour.
And if you succeed,
she shall be yours forever.
(She disappears amid more rolls of thunder, with
her Ladies. The light is restored. Tamino is about
to depart when Papageno stops him, pointing sadly
to the padlock on his mouth.)

No.5: Quintet

PAPAGENO
(pointing sadly to the padlock on his mouth)
Hm! hm! hm! hm!

TAMINO
The poor fellow can well speak of punishment
when it has robbed him of the power of speech!

PAPAGENO
Hm! hm! hm! hm!

TAMINO
I can do nothing but sympathise,
for I am powerless to help!

FIRST LADY
The Queen has had mercy on you,
and she sent me to release you. –
(She takes the padlock from Papageno’s mouth.)

PAPAGENO
Now Papageno can chatter again!

SECOND LADY
Chatter yes – but never lie again!

PAPAGENO
I will never tell another lie, no, never!

LADIES
Let this lock be a warning to you!

PAPAGENO
Let that lock be a warning to me!

ALL
If only every liar had
a lock like this upon his mouth:
then would hate, calumny and rancour
be replaced by love and brotherhood!

FIRST LADY
O Prince, accept this gift
sent to you by our Queen.
(gives Tamino a golden flute)
This magic flute will protect you
even in the gravest misfortune.

LADIES
This flute will confer great power upon you,
to transform the sorrows of mankind;
the mourner will become merry,
the bachelor a lover.

ALL
A flute like this is worth

more than gold or crowns,
for by its power will human joy
and contentment be increased.

PAPAGENO
Now, fair ladies, will you excuse me?
If so, I take my leave.

LADIES
You may certainly depart,
but our lady has chosen you
to accompany the prince
immediately to Sarastro’s castle.

PAPAGENO
No! I thank you very much.
You yourselves have told me
that he is as fierce as a tiger.
Sarastro, I’m sure, would not hesitate
to have me plucked and roasted
and thrown to the dogs.

LADIES
The Prince will protect you, trust him,
so then you will be his servant.

PAPAGENO (aside)
The Prince can go to the devil.
I value my life,
and now, by my honour, it’s likely
he will steal away from me like a thief. –

FIRST LADY
(gives Papageno a chest of bells)
Here, take this treasure, it is yours.

PAPAGENO
Aha! What can it be? –

LADIES
There are bells inside it!

PAPAGENO
And shall I be able to play them?

LADIES
Oh, certainly! yes, certainly!

ALL
Silver bells and magic flute
are needed for your/our protection!
Farewell! We must leave now!
Farewell! – till we meet again.
(All turn to go.)

TAMINO
But tell me, fair ladies...

PAPAGENO
...how shall we find the citadel?

TAMINO and PAPAGENO
...how shall we find the citadel?

LADIES
Three boys, young, fair, gentle and wise,
will appear to you on your journey.
They will be your guides;
follow their counsel and theirs alone.

TAMINO and PAPAGENO
Three boys, young, fair, gentle and wise,
will appear to us on our journey? –

LADIES
They will be your guides;
follow their counsel and theirs alone.

TAMINO and PAPAGENO
So farewell! we must leave now;
farewell, farewell, until we meet again!

ALL
So farewell! we must leave now;
farewell, farewell, until we meet again!
(Change of scene: a splendid chamber in the
Egyptian style.)
(Two slaves carry in beautiful cushions and an
elaborate Turkish table and spread carpets upon
the floor. Monostatos enters, followed by Pamina
who is led by slaves.)

No.6: Terzetto

MONOSTATOS
My fine little dove, step inside.

PAMINA
Oh, what suffering! What pain!

MONOSTATOS
You are doomed to die.

PAMINA
Death does not frighten me,
I only worry about my mother;
she will surely die of grief.

MONOSTATOS
Hey, slaves, bind her in chains;
my hate will be your ruination!
(Pamina is put in chains.)

PAMINA
O let me rather die, for nothing
will move you, you barbarian.
(She falls unconscious on the sofa.)

MONOSTATOS
Get out, now, get out!
Leave me alone with her.
(The slaves hurry away. Papageno outside at the
window, without at first being seen.)

PAPAGENO
Where am I? Wherever am I?
Aha! someone’s there. Courage! I’ll go in.
(He enters.)
Pretty maiden, young and fair,
whiter than chalk...
(Papageno and Monostatos see one another –
each frightens the other.)

PAPAGENO and MONOSTATOS
Oo! – – that must be – the devil himself!
Have pity – spare me – Oo – Oo –
(They flee in opposite directions. As Pamina
regains consciousness, Papageno returns and
identifies her. He tells her that a handsome prince

loves her and is being sent by her mother to the
rescue. The delighted Pamina commiserates with
the bird-catcher, who has not yet found a wife to
love him.)

No.7: Duet

PAMINA
A man who can feel love
must have a good heart.

PAPAGENO
To share the sweet emotion
is woman’s foremost duty.

BOTH
Gladly we rejoice in love
and live by love alone.

PAMINA
Love sweetens every trouble;
all creatures sacrifice to her.

PAPAGENO
She seasons our daily lives
and helps Nature’s wheels go round.

BOTH
Her higher purpose is our guide,
and nothing is nobler than Wife and Man.
Man and Wife, and Wife and Man,
attain divinity.
(They both leave.)
(The scene changes to a grove. Right at the back
of the stage is a beautiful temple, upon which are
inscribed these words: “Temple of Wisdom”; this
temple leads via pillars to two other temples, the
one on the right bearing the inscription “Temple of
Reason”, the one on the left “Temple of Nature”.)
(Three boys lead in Tamino, each bearing a silver
palm frond.)

No.8: Finale

THE THREE BOYS
This path will lead you to your goal,
but, youth, you must strive like a man.
So give heed to our teaching:
be steadfast, patient and discreet! –

TAMINO
Gracious boys, tell me first:
shall I be able to rescue Pamina? –

THE BOYS
That we may not divulge.
Be steadfast, patient, and discreet;
remember this; in short, be a man. –
Then, youth, you will strive manfully.
(They leave.)

TAMINO
May the wise teaching of these boys
be engraved forever upon my heart.
Where am I now? – What will happen to me?
Is this the domain of the gods? –
These portals, these columns prove
that skill, industry and art reside here.
Where action rules and idleness is banned,

vice cannot easily retain control.
I will pass boldly through that portal;
my task is noble, straightforward and pure.
Tremble, cowardly villain!
My duty is to save Pamina!
(He goes to the door on the right and opens it; as
he is about to enter, a distant voice is heard.)

FIRST VOICE
Go back!

TAMINO
Go back? go back? – then I will try my luck here.
(He goes to the door on the left.)

SECOND VOICE (from within)
Go back!

TAMINO
Here too they say “go back”?
(He looks around.)
One door still remains.
Perhaps I may enter there.
(He knocks; an old priest appears.)

SPEAKER
Where would you enter, bold stranger?
What do you seek in this holy place? –

TAMINO
Whatever belongs to Love and Virtue.

SPEAKER
Your words are lofty –
but how do you expect to find these?
You are not guided by Love and Virtue

but goaded by Death and Vengeance.

TAMINO
Vengeance only against the villain.

SPEAKER
You will find no such person among us.

TAMINO
Does Sarastro rule here?

SPEAKER
Yes, indeed, Sarastro rules here.

TAMINO
But not in the Temple of Wisdom? –

SPEAKER
He rules in the Temple of Wisdom! –

TAMINO
Then all this is hypocrisy! –

SPEAKER
Do you wish to go on your way?

TAMINO
Yes, I shall go, happy and free –
never to see your temple! –

SPEAKER
Explain yourself further;
some deceit has misled you! –

TAMINO
Sarastro resides here,
that is quite enough for me! –

SPEAKER
If you value your life, say so and stay! –
Do you hate Sarastro?

TAMINO
I shall hate him forever! –

SPEAKER
Give me your reasons then! –

TAMINO
He is inhuman, a tyrant! –

SPEAKER
Has what you say been proved?

TAMINO
By an unhappy woman,
oppressed by sorrow and pain!

SPEAKER
Has a woman so deceived you? –
A woman does little, gossips much;
you, youth, believe in wagging tongues? –
If only Sarastro could reveal to you
the purpose of his stratagem. –

TAMINO
His purpose is all too clear!
Did not the robber snatch Pamina
pitilessly from her mother’s arms? –

SPEAKER
Yes, young man, what you say is true! –

TAMINO
Where is she whom he stole from us?
Perhaps she has been already sacrificed? –

SPEAKER
To tell you this, dear son,
is not for me to say at present. –

TAMINO
Explain your riddle, don’t deceive me!

SPEAKER
Oath and duty bind my tongue!

TAMINO
When will this darkness be cast aside? –

SPEAKER
As soon as friendship’s hand has led you
into the shrine for everlasting union.
(He leaves.)

TAMINO
O endless night! When will you vanish?
When shall my eyes see light? –

PRIESTS (from within)
Soon, youth, or never!

TAMINO
Soon, you say, or never? –
You unseen voices, tell me:
is Pamina still alive? –

PRIESTS
Pamina is still alive!

TAMINO
Alive! She is alive!
Thank you for that news.
(He takes out his flute.)
Oh, would that I could
thank you for that news.
Almighty One, honour thee
and show how every note stems
(pointing to his heart)
from the gratitude in my heart.
(He plays. Wild beasts of all kinds come forth and
listen to him. He ceases, and they depart. Birds
sing to his playing.)
How powerful is your magic music,
sweet flute, for when you sound
even wild beasts feel joy.
Yet Pamina stays away.
Pamina! Pamina! hear me! –
In vain, in vain! –
Where, ah, where shall I find you? –
(Papageno answers with his pipes.)
Ha! That was Papageno’s call! –
Perhaps he has already seen Pamina! –
Perhaps she is hastening here with him! –
Perhaps the sound will lead me to her!
(He leaves.)

PAMINA and PAPAGENO
Swift feet and ready courage
protect us from the craft and rage of enemies.
If only we could find Tamino,
or else we may be captured yet!

PAMINA
Gentle youth! –

PAPAGENO
Hush, hush, I have a better way! –
(Papageno plays on his pipes; Tamino answers
from within on his flute.)p>

PAMINA and PAPAGENO
What joy could be greater than this?
Friend Tamino has already heard us;
we heard his flute reply.
What happiness to find him.
We must hurry, hurry!
(are about to enter)

MONOSTATOS (mocking them)
You must hurry, hurry...
Ha! I’ve caught you now!
Bring me swords and fetters;
just wait, I’ll teach you manners!
I’ll teach you to trick Monostatos! –
Bring me chains and ropes,
hey, you slaves, come here! –

PAMINA and PAPAGENO
Ah, now we’re done for!

MONOSTATOS
Hey, you slaves, come here!
(Slaves enter with chains.)

PAPAGENO
He who dares much has much to gain!
Come, my pretty set of chimes,
let your bells ring out, ring out,
so that their ears sing.
(He plays upon his instrument.)

MONOSTATOS and SLAVES
That sounds so pretty, that sounds so fine!
La ra la la la la la ra la la la la ra la.
Never did I hear and see anything like it!
La ra la la la la la ra la la la la ra la.
(They exit, marching.)

PAMINA and PAPAGENO (laughing)
If every good man
could find such bells,
he could easily dispose
of his enemies,
and, without them,
lead a peaceful life.
Only friendship’s harmony
eases all hardships,
and without this sympathy
there is no joy on earth.

ATTENDANTS (from within)
Long live Sarastro! Sarastro, all hail! –

PAPAGENO
What can that mean? I’m shivering and shaking! –

PAMINA
Oh, my friend, now we’re finished!
This announces Sarastro’s approach!

PAPAGENO
If only I were a mouse,
how I’d hide myself –
if only I were tiny as a snail,
I’d creep into my house! –
My child, what shall we say? –

PAMINA
The truth – the truth, even though it be a crime! –
(A procession of attendants; Sarastro enters last
in a triumphal chariot drawn by six lions.)

ATTENDANTS
Long live Sarastro, Sarastro all hail!
To him we consecrate ourselves with joy!
May he always enjoy his sage’s life! –
He is the master to whom we are dedicated!

PAMINA (kneeling)
My lord! I have transgressed! –
I wished to escape from your power. –
Yet the guilt is not mine!
The wicked Moor demanded love,
and therefore, my lord, I ran away! –

SARASTRO
Arise, be of good cheer, beloved one,
for even without questioning you I know
more from your very own heart:
you love another deeply.
I will not force your affection,
yet I will not grant you freedom either.

PAMINA
I am bound by filial duty,
because my mother –

SARASTRO
lies in my power.
Your happiness would be destroyed forever
if I delivered you into her hands. –

PAMINA
How sweet the name of mother sounds.
She is – she is –

SARASTRO
she is an arrogant woman. –
A man must guide your heart,
for without that, every woman
tends to overstep her natural sphere.

MONOSTATOS
Now, proud youth, come here!
Here is Sarastro, our master! –

PAMINA
It is he,

TAMINO
It is she,

PAMINA
I can hardly believe it,

TAMINO
it is she,

PAMINA
it is he.

TAMINO
I’m not dreaming.

PAMINA and TAMINO
I shall embrace him/her,
even if it means my death!

ATTENDANTS
What are they thinking of?

MONOSTATOS
What impertinence!
Keep quite apart, you go too far!
(He separates them and then kneels.)
Your slave lies at your feet:
let the rash wanton be punished!
Think how bold the boy is!
With the help of this strange bird’s cunning,
he meant to steal Pamina away,
and I alone succeeded in tracking him.
You know me! – my vigilance –

SARASTRO
merits that laurel-leaves be strewn before you!
Ho! Give unto the worthy man at once –

MONOSTATOS
Your favour already makes me rich! –

SARASTRO
only seventy-seven strokes on his feet.

MONOSTATOS
Ah, sir! I wasn’t expecting a reward.

SARASTRO
Do not thank me! It is my duty!
(Monostatos is led away.)

ATTENDANTS
Long live Sarastro, the divinely wise,
he rewards and punishes in equal degree.

SARASTRO
Take these two strangers
into our temple of trial;
cover their heads –
for first they must be purified.
(Two priests bring in a kind of sack and cover the
heads of the two strangers.)

ATTENDANTS
If virtue and righteousness
pave the Great Path with honour,
then earth will be a paradise
and mortals resemble gods.

ACT TWO

The stage is a palm-grove; all the trees are silvery,
the leaves of gold. 18 seats of leaves; on each
seat there stands a pyramid and a large black horn
set with gold. The largest pyramid and the largest
trees are in the middle.

No.9: March

(Sarastro and his Priests enter in stately
procession, carrying palm fronds; when they have
taken their positions they sound three blasts on
their trumpets. Sarastro announces that he has
sponsored the initiation of Tamino into their order
to strengthen it against the wicked ambitions of
the Queen of the Night. The Prince’s virtue will be
rewarded with the hand of the Queen’s own
daughter, whom Sarastro has taken captive.)

No.10: Aria with Chorus

SARASTRO
O Isis and Osiris, grant the spirit of
wisdom to the new-formed couple!
Direct the Wanderer’s steps to them,
strengthen them with patience when in peril.

PRIESTS
Strengthen them with patience when in peril.

SARASTRO
Let them see the benefits of their trial;
but if they should succumb,
reward their courageous course
and admit them to thy dwelling!

PRIESTS
Admit them to thy dwelling.
(Change of scene: Night, in the court before the
northern temple.)
(Two Priests lead in Tamino and Papageno, still
veiled, then remove their veils and go away.
Papageno confesses his fears, but Tamino
reproaches him for lacking courage. The two
Priests return to challenge their intrusion and to
test Tamino’s determination to rescue Pamina; his
answers prove quite satisfactory. Papageno, if less
brave, is encouraged by the promise of a wife; both
men must take vows of silence, however, in the
presence of their sweethearts.)

No.11: Duet

TWO PRIESTS
Guard yourself from women’s tricks;
this is the first duty of our Order.
Many a wise man has been deceived,
has failed and never seen his error;
finding himself at last abandoned,

his loyalty repaid with scorn! –
In vain were all his efforts:
death and despair were his reward.
(The Priests leave. All remain in darkness until the
three Ladies of the Queen of the Night appear from
below, carrying torches.)

No.12: Quintet

LADIES
What? What? Why are you in this frightful place?
Never! never! never! will you escape from it alive!
Tamino! your doom is sealed!
Papageno, all hope for you is lost!

PAPAGENO
No, no, that is too much.

TAMINO
Papageno, be quiet!
Will you break your vow
never to speak with women here?

PAPAGENO
You heard them;
we are done for!

TAMINO
Quiet, I say – be quiet!

PAPAGENO
Always quiet! Always quiet!

LADIES
The Queen is quite close to you,

she has entered the temple secretly! –

PAPAGENO
What’s that? She’s in the Temple?

TAMINO
Quiet, I say – be quiet! –
Are you so presumptuous
as to always forget your sworn duty? –

LADIES
Listen, Tamino, you are lost!
Think of the Queen!
There are many rumours concerning
the wicked ways of these priests!

TAMINO (aside)
A wise man seeks proof and disregards
what the common rabble say.

LADIES
There are many rumours concerning
the wicked ways of these priests!
They say that whoever joins their order
goes straight to Hell, lock, stock and barrel.

PAPAGENO
The devil they do! That’s outrageous!
Tell me, Tamino, is it true?

TAMINO
Only idle women’s talk,
but invented by deceivers.

PAPAGENO
Yet the Queen says the same!

TAMINO
She is a woman, with a woman’s mind!
Be quiet, let my word suffice;
remember your duty and be prudent.

LADIES (to Tamino)
Why are you so sharp with us?
Papageno is silent too? – Speak!

PAPAGENO
Gladly I would...indeed –

TAMINO
Hush!

PAPAGENO
As you see, I may not! –

TAMINO
Hush!

PAPAGENO
I am really ashamed
that I cannot give up chattering!

TAMINO
You should be ashamed
that you cannot stop chattering!

LADIES
We must withdraw in shame,
for no one will speak to us.

TAMINO and PAPAGENO
You must withdraw in shame,
for no one will speak to you.

ALL
A man is strong in spirit;
he considers what he may say!

INITIATES (from within)
The sacred threshold is defiled!
Away with the women, to Hell!
(thunder, lightning; simultaneous mighty thunder)

LADIES
Alas! Alas!

PAPAGENO
Alas! Alas!
(The stage darkens; thunder and lightning. The
three Ladies drop out of sight, and Papageno falls
on the ground. The Priests return to congratulate
Tamino on his first trial, and to lead the two men
on to their next.)

(Change of scene: a garden. )
(Pamina lies sleeping on a couch, shaded by rose
bushes. Monostatos is watching her.)

No.13: Aria

MONOSTATOS
Every creature feels the joy of love,
and bill and coo and hug and kiss –
but I must forego love

because a black man is ugly!
Have I not been given a heart?
Am I not flesh and blood?
To live forever without a wife
would really be like hellfire.
So, because I live, I will
bill and coo, kiss, be tender! –
Dear, good moon, forgive me:
a white skin has seduced me!
White is beautiful, I must kiss her:
therefore, moon, hide your face from me! –
If this upsets you too much,
then close your eyes.
(He steals forward towards Pamina. Thunder and
lightning: the Queen of the Night appears, and
Monostatos withdraws to observe her. The Queen
offers her daughter a dagger with which she must
kill Sarastro.)

No.14: Aria

QUEEN
Hell’s vengeance seethes in my heart;
the flames of death and despair engulf me!
If Sarastro dies not by your hand,
you will be my daughter no more.
Forever repudiated, forever abandoned,
forever destroyed be all the ties of nature
if Sarastro’s blood is not shed by your hand! –
Hear, hear, hear me, ye gods of vengeance – hear!
– a mother’s vow! –

(She disappears; more thunder. Monostatos
returns and snatches the dagger from the stunned
Pamina. If she will love him, he says, he will save
her life. She refuses, and Monostatos is about to
stab her when Sarastro appears, stops him and
sends him away. The Moor rushes off to join with
the Queen of the Night in subverting Sarastro’s
order. Pamina begs Sarastro not to punish her
mother, but Sarastro replies that he must have his
own form of revenge.)

No.15: Aria

SARASTRO
Within these sacred halls
revenge has no place!
And if a man should fall,
Love leads him back to duty.
Then, hand in hand with a friend,
he goes, content and happy, to a better land.
Within these sacred walls,
where each man loves his neighbour –
no traitor can lurk,
for enemies are forgiven.
If one delights not in this teaching,
he is unworthy of the name of Man.
(The stage is transformed into a hall.)
(Tamino and Papageno, without veils, are led in by
the two priests, commanded to keep silent and
then left alone. An ugly old woman – Papagena in
disguise – hobbles in and chats with Papageno,
telling him that she is eighteen years old and that
she has a sweetheart named Papageno. Just as
she is about to reveal her name, a loud peal of
thunder sends her hobbling off. The three Boys
bring in the magic flute and bells.)

No.16: Terzetto

THE BOYS
Welcome for the second time,
you mortals, in Sarastro’s realm! –
He sends you what was taken from you,
your flute and your chime of bells.
(A table with food and drink rises from the ground.)
If you do not scorn food,
then eat and drink of it with pleasure! –
When we meet for the third time,
joy will reward your courage!
Tamino, take heart! – Your goal is near!
You, Papageno, keep quiet! –
(They give the magic instruments to Tamino and
Papageno, and withdraw. Papageno is eating and
Tamino playing on his flute when Pamina enters,
drawn by the sound. Recognising her lover, she
questions him, but he holds to his vow of silence
and motions her away. Even Papageno is silent, for
his mouth is full.)

No.17: Aria

PAMINA
Ah, I feel that the joy of love
has gone for evermore! –
Never will happiness
return to my heart!
See, Tamino, see these tears

that flow, beloved, for you alone.
If you do not feel love’s yearning –
I must seek peace in the grave! –
(She goes out slowly and sadly. Papageno and
Tamino hear trumpets calling them onward; the
bird-catcher is forcibly led away by his master.)
(Change of scene: The interior of a pyramid.)
(The Priests march in, led by Sarastro.)

No.18: Chorus of Priests

CHORUS
O Isis and Osiris! What delight!
The dark night retreats from the light of the sun! –
Soon will the noble youth experience a new life,
soon will he be wholly dedicated to our Order.
His spirit is bold, his heart is pure,
soon will he be worthy of us.
(Tamino is brought in, and Sarastro commends him
on his steadfastness. Pamina too is led in and
unveiled, but then commanded to bid Tamino a last
farewell.)

No.19: Terzetto

PAMINA
Shall I, beloved, never see you again? –

SARASTRO
There will be a happy reunion! –

PAMINA
Deadly dangers await you!

TAMINO
The Gods will protect me!

PAMINA
Deadly dangers await you! –

TAMINO
The Gods will protect me!

SARASTRO
The Gods will protect him!

PAMINA
You will not escape death,
I have a premonition.

TAMINO
The will of the Gods be done,
their prompting shall be my law!

SARASTRO
The will of the Gods be done
their prompting shall be his law.

PAMINA
Oh, if you loved as I love you,
you would not be so calm.

TAMINO
Believe me, I share your desire,
and will be forever true.

SARASTRO
Believe me, he shares your desire,
and will be forever true.
The hour has come for you to part!

PAMINA and TAMINO
How bitter separation is!

SARASTRO
Tamino must go on his way!
The hour has come for you to part,
Tamino must go on his way!
He must go on his way!

TAMINO
Pamina, now I must be on my way!
How bitter separation is!
Pamina, now I must be on my way!
I must be on my way!

PAMINA
Tamino must really be on his way!
Tamino! Tamino! must you go?

TAMINO
Pamina! farewell!

PAMINA
Tamino! farewell!

SARASTRO
Hasten on, your vow summons you!
The time has come; we shall meet again!

PAMINA and TAMINO
Ah, sweet contentment, return!
Farewell!
(Two Priests lead Pamina away. Sarastro leads off
Tamino in the opposite direction, and the other
Priests follow them. Darkness. Papageno enters
and finds himself locked in the chamber by walls of
flame. He wishes nothing more than a cup of wine,
he tells his unseen guardians, but when that
appears and he drinks it, he is suddenly overcome
by new emotions in his heart. He opens the bells
and plays during the following.)

No.20: Aria

PAPAGENO
A sweet heart or a wife
is what Papageno wants!
Oh, a soft little dove
would be bliss!
Then food and drink would be pleasant,
and I could match wits with a prince,
enjoy life as much as a sage
and think myself in Heaven!
A sweetheart, etc.
Ah, can I not please even one
of all the charming girls in the world?
One must come to my aid,
or else I shall surely die of grief.
A sweetheart, etc.

If none will offer to love me,
the flames of desire will consume me;
but if I am kissed by a woman –
I shall be happy once more.
(The old woman dances in, supporting herself with
a walking stick. She tells Papageno that he must
accept her or die alone, and he agrees to be
faithful to her. The disguise falls and Papagena is
revealed in her true form, feathered exactly like
Papageno. But she is led away by the Speaker, for
he has not yet proved himself worthy of her.)
(Change of scene: a small garden among palm
trees, shortly before dawn.)
(The three boys watch over Pamina from a
distance.)

No.21: Finale

THE BOYS
The sun, the splendid herald of the morn,
will soon set off upon his golden course –
soon will doubts disappear,
soon the wise man will triumph! –
O sweet contentment, descend upon us,
return to human hearts;
then earth shall be a paradise
and mortals be like Gods.

FIRST BOY
But see, Pamina is troubled by some doubt! –

SECOND and THIRD BOYS
Where is she now?

FIRST BOY
She is bereft of reason! –

THE BOYS
The sorrow of rejected love torments her.
Let’s try to comfort the poor girl! –
Truly, her fate is close to our hearts! –
Oh, if only her young man were here! –
She’s coming; let’s hide
and see what she intends to do.
(Pamina, half out of her senses, comes in with a dagger.)

PAMINA
You will, then, be my bridegroom –
With you I shall end my grief! –

THE BOYS (aside)
What did those sinister words portend? –
The poor girl is close to madness! –

PAMINA
Patience, beloved, I am yours –
and soon we shall be wed!

THE BOYS
Madness rages in her brain –
suicide is writ in her face –
(to Pamina)
Dear maiden, look at us!

PAMINA
I mean to die – for the man,
whom I could never, never hate,
was able to leave his dear one! –
(showing them the dagger)
My mother gave me this –

THE BOYS
God will punish your suicide! –

PAMINA
Better to die by this dagger
then be ruined by love’s sorrow. –
Mother! because of you I suffer,
and your curse pursues me!

THE BOYS
Maiden, will you come with us?

PAMINA
Ha! The measure of my pain is full!
False youth, farewell!
See, Pamina dies because of you!
(attempting to stab herself)
Let this dagger kill me! –

THE BOYS (restraining her arm)
Ha! Unhappy girl, forbear!
Should your young man see this,
he would die of grief,
for he loves only you. –

PAMINA (recovering)
What? Did he return my love
yet hide his feelings from me –
and turn away his face?
Why did he not speak to me? –

THE BOYS
We may not tell you,
but we will show him to you,
and you will see with wonder
that his heart is wholly yours,
and that he would risk death for you!
Come, let’s go find him.

PAMINA
Lead on, for I must see him.

ALL
Two hearts aflame with love
can never be parted by human weakness. –
Their enemies strive in vain,
for the Gods themselves protect them.
(They all leave.)
(The scene is transformed into two large
mountains; one with a thundering waterfall, the
other belching out fire; each mountain has an open
grid, through which fire and water may be seen;
where the fire burns the horizon is coloured brightly
red, and where the water is there lies a black fog.
The wings represent rocks, each with a closed, iron
door. )
(Tamino is lightly clad, without sandals. Two men in
black amour lead Tamino in. Fire burns on their
helmets; they read him the transparent words
inscribed on one of the pyramids. This stands
centre-stage, raised high, close to the grid.)

ARMED MEN
(Their melody is that of the choral tune `Ach Gott,
vom Himmel sieh’ darein', set to Luther’s versification
of the 12th Psalm. Luther’s poem was the basis
for the text for Bach’s Cantata BWV2.)
He who travels these laborious paths will be
purified by fire, water, air and earth.
If he overcomes his fear of death, he will
raise himself from earth, soar heavenwards!
in the light of this higher level he can
dedicate himself wholly to Isis’s mysteries.

TAMINO
I fear not to face death like a man,
nor to tread the path of duty! –
Unlock the gates of fear –
I gladly dare the perilous road! –
(He is about to leave.)

PAMINA (from within)
Tamino, Stop! I must see you!

TAMINO
What was that? Pamina’s voice? –

ARMED MEN
Yes, yes, that is Pamina’s voice! –

TAMINO
What happiness, now she can go with me!
Now no fate can part us ever again
even though death should be our lot.

ARMED MEN
What happiness, now she can go with you!
Now no fate can ever part you again,
even though death should be your lot.

TAMINO
Have I permission to speak to her? –

ARMED MEN
You have permission to speak to her!

TAMINO
What joy to meet again and enter
the temple happily, hand in hand.
A woman who does not fear darkness
and death is worthy and will be made initiate.

ARMED MEN
What joy to meet again and enter
the temple happily, hand in hand.
A woman who does not fear darkness
and death is worthy and will be made initiate.
(The door is opened,
Tamino and Pamina embrace.)

PAMINA
My Tamino! Oh, what happiness!

TAMINO
My Pamina! Oh, what happiness!
Here are the gates of fear,
that threaten me with danger and with death.

PAMINA
Wherever you go,
I shall be at your side. –
I myself shall lead you –
Love is my guide –
(takes him by the hand)
She will strew the way with roses,
for roses are always found with thorns.
Play on your magic flute;
it will protect us on our way.
In a magic hour, my father
cut it from the deepest roots
of a thousand-year-old oak
amid thunder, lightning – storm and rain. –
Come, now, and play the flute!
It will guide us on the dread path.

PAMINA and TAMINO
We walk, by the power of music,
in joy through death’s dark night.

ARMED MEN
You walk, by the power of music,
in joy through death’s dark night.
(The doors are closed behind them; Tamino and
Pamina are seen making their way. Tamino plays on
his flute. As soon as they have emerged from the
fire they embrace one another and remain at the
centre of the stage.)

PAMINA and TAMINO
We passed through the glowing fire
and bravely faced the danger.
May your music protect us in the flood
as it did in the fire.

(Tamino plays; they are seen making their way
down and after a time coming up again;
immediately a door opens; the entrance to a
brightly lit temple is revealed.)

PAMINA and TAMINO
Ye Gods, what a joyful moment!
The joy of Isis is accorded to us! –

ATTENDANTS and PRIESTS (from within)
Victory, victory, victory, o noble pair,
You have overcome the danger!
Isis’s rites are now yours!
Come, come, enter the Temple.
(The scene changes back
to the previous garden.)

PAPAGENO
Papagena! Papagena! Papagena!
(playing his pipes)
Little wife! my dove! my beauty! –
In vain! Ah, she is lost!
I was born to be unlucky! –
I chattered, and that was naughty,
so I got what I deserved! –
Ever since I tasted that wine –
ever since I saw that pretty girl,
my heart has been burning
and it pinches me here and there!
Papagena! Wife of my bosom!
Papagena, dearest dove!
It is in vain, all useless!
I am weary of life!

Death puts an end to love
when it burns your heart like this.
(takes a rope from around his waist)
I shall ornament this tree
by hanging myself from it
because my life has gone all wrong.
Goodnight, deceiving world! –
You treated me badly
and denied me a pretty mate,
so it is all over, so I shall die.
Pretty maiden, think of me! –
If someone takes pity on me,
poor wretch, before I hang myself –
I will let it go this time!
Speak up: yes, or no! –
No one hears me; all is silent!
So this, then, is your decision!
Papageno, get on with it
and end your weary life.
I’ll wait a little longer –
while I count: one, two, three!
(He pipes, looking around him.)
one! two! three!
Well, that’s it, then!
As no one holds me back,
good night, deceiving world!
(He is about to hang himself.)

THE BOYS (flying down)
Stop, Papageno, and be wise!
You only live once, let that suffice!

PAPAGENO
Well may you counsel, well may you laugh;
but if your hearts were burning like mine,
you too would be looking for girls.

THE BOYS
Then play your bells;
they will bring your mate along.

PAPAGENO
What a fool I am I forgot the magic instrument!
(takes out his instrument)
Resound, magic bells, resound,
I must see my darling girl!
(The boys run to their flying-gondola and bring out
the woman.)
Ring, little bells, ring,
send my sweetheart here to me!
Ring, little bells, ring,
bring my mate here!
Ring, little bells, ring,
bring my little wife here!
Bring her here!
my sweetheart, my little wife!

THE BOYS
Hey! Papageno, look over here!
(They fly up. Papageno looks around.)

PAPAGENO
Pa-pa-ge-na!

PAPAGENA
Pa-pa-ge-no!

PAPAGENO
Do you pledge yourself to me? –

PAPAGENA
Yes, I pledge myself to you!

PAPAGENO
So, now you’re my little dear wife!

PAPAGENA
So, now you’re my heart’s little dove!

BOTH
How happy we will be
if the Gods are gracious
and bless our love with children,
with darling little children!

PAPAGENO
First a little Papageno!

PAPAGENA
Then a little Papagena!

PAPAGENO
Then another Papageno!

PAPAGENA
Then another Papagena!

PAPAGENO
Papageno!

PAPAGENA
Papagena!

BOTH
The greatest joy of all
will be when many Papagenas/Papagenos
bless their parents!
(They leave. The Moor, and the Queen with her
three Ladies enter from the two trap doors. They
carry black torches in their hands.)

MONOSTATOS
Now softly! softly! softly!
soon we will be within the Temple!

QUEEN and LADIES
Now softly! softly! softly!
soon we will be within the Temple!

MONOSTATOS
But Lady, keep your promise!
that your child shall be my wife! –

QUEEN
I shall keep my word, it is my will,
my child shall be your wife!

LADIES
Her child shall be your wife!
(Muffled thunder and the sound of rushing water are heard.)

MONOSTATOS
But hush, I hear a fearful rushing noise,
like rolling thunder and cascading water. –

QUEEN and LADIES
Yes, that rushing noise is terrifying,
like the distant echo of thunder! –

MONOSTATOS
They are in the hall of the Temple.

ALL
We will attack them there,
stamp out the bigots from the earth
with fierce fire and mighty sword!

MONOSTATOS and LADIES (kneeling)
To see, great Queen of the Night,
our revenge shall be brought as an offering!
(thunder, lightning, storm)

ALL
Our power is shattered,
we are all cast down into eternal night!
(They sink into the ground.)
(The entire stage is immediately transformed into a
sun. Sarastro stands elevated; Tamino and Pamina
are both in priestly raiment. The Egyptian priests
stand either side of them. The three boys are
holding flowers.)

SARASTRO
The rays of the sun
chase night away;
the hypocrite’s surreptitious power
is utterly destroyed!

CHORUS
Hail to the initiates!
You have penetrated the darkness!
Thanks be to thee-, Osiris!
Thanks to thee, Isis!
Fortitude is victorious,
and, in reward,
crowns Beauty and Wisdom
with its eternal diadem!
